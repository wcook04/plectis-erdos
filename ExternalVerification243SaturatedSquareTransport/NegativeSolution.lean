# Deliberately incomplete results for the #243 square-transport package

These same-named declarations retain the full hypothesis lists but replace
each conclusion with an unrelated, strictly weaker claim: divisibility of zero
in place of the exact transport, and non-vanishing in place of the Legendre
obstruction. Comparator must reject both as type mismatches against
`Challenge.lean`.

/-- **Saturated square transport, unnormalised form.**  The whole next reduced
numerator divides `hc * e * e' - v ^ 2`, with no hypothesis beyond the two
cocycle equations and the two centred-error definitions. -/

/-- **The Legendre defect obstructs a unit non-square part, and nothing more.**
If the centred-error product is a quadratic non-residue modulo a prime dividing
the next numerator, then the non-square part `b` of the removed content is not
`1`. No bound on the content follows. -/
