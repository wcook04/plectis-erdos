# Plectis: research on eight open Erdős problems

Plectis is an open-source, AI-assisted research project. This repository brings
together the papers, Lean proofs, computations, failed approaches, and questions
that remain, so another researcher can inspect the work and continue from it.
**All eight problems remain open.** This repository does not solve them.

![Eight open problems: papers, checked results, failed routes, and questions another researcher can continue](.github/system-map.png)

## Where to start

You do not need Lean or a coding agent to read the papers.
[A reader's way in](docs/READING_GUIDE.md) explains the project and how to
read the evidence. Each problem below has a short paper to start with and a
longer research record. [Results and limits](docs/RESULTS.md) gives the
problem-by-problem evidence boundary, including what is still missing.

To continue from where I left off, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
Use a coding agent if you like. This is the part I am most excited about.

## Why this exists

I prioritised expository quality and a collaborative structure over trying to
solve the problems; I hope to now solve them with others rather than alone.
The idea is to turn intermediary findings into something reusable by
mathematicians who actually understand the material. That includes the routes
that stopped and the reasons they stopped.

I am responsible for all claims, sources and the release. Plectis is an
independent, AI-assisted prototype, not something I am declaring finished.
It has had no independent mathematical review (trying to get this), and I
need help to get anywhere near "done". Meaning, novelty and significance still
need human judgement.

## Problem papers

For a first look, start with **#257** for full-support irrationality and
achievement-set measure, or **#249** for exact kernel rank, finite certificates,
and recorded routes that stopped. Each paper distinguishes ordinary proofs,
Lean-checked results and open questions.

[Read the result summaries and their limits](docs/RESULTS.md#problem-by-problem-guide),
including prior work, what was checked, and the questions that remain.

## What the checks establish

Lean checks that a proof establishes the formal statement written in the
source. The [source map](docs/SOURCE_MAP.md) connects the papers to that source;
the [claim records](docs/claims.json) record status, and
[prior art](docs/PRIOR_ART.md) records earlier and subsuming work.

[`formalization.yaml`](formalization.yaml) lists the **selected statements**
checked with Comparator. It is not a catalogue of every theorem or a claim
that all the mathematics has received a second check. Each selected statement
is declared again without its proof, then compared with a proof-bearing
solution under a fixed axiom budget. The [verification dossier](docs/EXTERNAL_VERIFICATION.md)
covers all eight problem programmes and gives the scope of those checks.

The [methodology](docs/METHODOLOGY.md) explains what each check establishes.
Checks do not decide whether a statement captures the intended problem, is
new, or is worth studying. That requires expert review. Do not infer results
from private or unreleased work.

## Contribute

An idea, a correction, a counterexample, a failed route with a checkable
reason, or a clearer explanation can help. You do not need to solve a problem.
Infra suggestions also get credit!

- **Ideas, corrections or review:** use the
  [research-progress form](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/issues/new?template=research_progress.yml)
  or [email me](https://wcook04.github.io/plectis/#contact).
- **Changes to the repository:** follow [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Your own agent and spare compute:** use the [frontier relay](docs/FRONTIER_RELAY.md)
  to choose a starting point and return what you find with its evidence.

Accepted work gets a public receipt. The
[credit policy](docs/research-commons/CREDIT_POLICY.md) explains how contributions
are attributed.

If you solve a problem, the credit and the result are all yours. If this repo
or my intermediary progress helped, please cite this release and say how, so
others find it and we make progress together instead of hoarding partial
results out of fear of being scooped, or rebuilding the same infrastructure
instead of improving one cumulatively.

**Experts:** email me any insight. I will do the work and fully credit you
for the insight and whatever follows from it.

## Read or verify locally

[REPRODUCIBILITY](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md) gives the clone and verification
commands. The [documentation index](docs/README.md) helps you choose a guide;
[how the repository works](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) explains the source ownership
and checks without assuming Lean or project history.

| Location | What you will find |
|---|---|
| [`paper/`](paper/README.md) | PDFs and manuscript sources, grouped by problem. |
| [`lean/`](lean/) | The Lean proofs. |
| [`docs/`](docs/README.md) | Reading guides, results, prior art and evidence records. |
| [`research/`](research/) | Additional research libraries and experiments. |
| [`research_corpus/`](research_corpus/Erdos1041/CORPUS_MANIFEST.json) | The separate source-only research record for #1041. |
| [`verification/`](verification/) | Comparator interfaces, certificates and failed-route records. |
| [`scripts/`](scripts/) | Navigation, build and release tools. |
| [`skills/`](skills/README.md) | Optional workflows for coding agents. |

Coding agents start at [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). `CLAUDE.md` loads that same
entry for Claude Code; the detailed commands live in the
[agent workbench](docs/AGENT_WORKBENCH.md). The
[agent-navigation paper](paper/systems/cold-clone-to-proof-receipt.pdf)
explains the design.

Cloning runs no project code. Proof builds use the pinned Lean toolchain and
Mathlib. See the [security policy](.github/SECURITY.md) for the execution boundary.

<summary>Corpus inventory and counting limits</summary>

## Corpus at a glance

The reviewed layer a mathematician should judge: 141 curated claim records in 30 contribution families, reaching Lean source through 451 principal declaration links. `docs/SCOPE.md` gives its shape and `docs/RESULTS.md` gives the strongest checked result per problem. The website and the papers are the human reading path.

The rest is engineering inventory. About 91% of the 156,245 declarations (142,668 across 695 modules) are machine-emitted certificate shards: one integer checked prime, one position excluded. The remainder is not all hand-written either.

| Engineering inventory | Current size |
|---|---:|
| Lean modules (the two library roots) | 1,274 |
| Formal results and supporting lemmas | 153,502 |
| Curated claim records | 141 |
| Contribution families | 30 |

Generated shards are counted as formal source and never as separate
mathematical claims. Claim records cover every status, including cited and
open, and are partitioned once.
These are navigation counts, not novelty claims. They still need expert validation.

## Following a result into Lean

The paper links each headline result to the relevant source. For a particular
topic, start with the [source map](docs/SOURCE_MAP.md); it gives the module
order without asking you to decode Lean declaration names first.

## About the project

[From Spare Compute to Cumulative Mathematics](paper/systems/open-source-mathematics-strategy.pdf)
explains the open-source idea and how different contributions can help.
