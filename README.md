# Plectis: research on eight open Erdős problems

![Eight open problems: papers, checked results, failed routes, and questions another researcher can continue](.github/system-map.png)

The full-support Mersenne series is irrational in every integer base `b ≥ 2`,
and the base-2 achievement set has measure one. That is a completed theorem
family in this checkout, not a solution of Erdős #257: every infinite support,
and the `1/2` and `1/21` branches, remain open.

Plectis is the public record of that work and of seven further programmes —
[68](https://www.erdosproblems.com/68),
[243](https://www.erdosproblems.com/243),
[249](https://www.erdosproblems.com/249),
[251](https://www.erdosproblems.com/251),
[257](https://www.erdosproblems.com/257),
[269](https://www.erdosproblems.com/269),
[1041](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1041) and
[1049](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1049).
**All eight problems remain open.** This repository does not solve them.

The useful path is ordinary. Pick a problem. Read the short paper. Open the
longer record for failed routes, finite evidence, and remaining obligations.
Then read the evidence boundary before taking a next question. For a first look,
start with **#257** for that completed theorem family, or **#249** for exact kernel rank,
finite certificates, and recorded routes that stopped. Progress by problem is
in [RESULTS](docs/RESULTS.md).

I am responsible for all claims, sources and the release. Plectis is an
independent, AI-assisted prototype. It has had no independent mathematical
review, and I need help. Novelty and significance still need human judgement.
If you solve a problem, the credit is yours. If this repo helped, please cite
the release and say how. Anyone can contribute, including by formalising
mathematics already known analytically, and receive due credit. Start with
[A reader's way in](HUMAN_ENTRY.md).

The notes follow Terence Tao's public guidance on how AI mathematics should be
expositioned; that is a writing standard, not a review of this project.

The [website](https://wcook04.github.io/plectis/) is the human browse path:
[mathematics pages](https://wcook04.github.io/plectis/maths/) for each short
and long paper. Navigation, validation and contribution workflows also plug
into coding agents via [`AGENTS.override.md`](AGENTS.override.md); they are
not required to read the papers.

## Problem papers

  [short paper](paper/68/erdos-68-factorial-denominator-irrationality.pdf) ·
  [longer paper](paper/68/erdos68-factorial-reasoning-surface.pdf).
  A GMP non-unit carry at `m = 300000` and a continued-fraction bound
  `q ≥ 2^39990` are incomparable finite exclusions. Producing cofinal carries
  remains open.
- **[#243](https://www.erdosproblems.com/243)** · Reciprocal-tail rigidity ·
  [short paper](paper/243/erdos-243-reciprocal-tail-rigidity.pdf) ·
  [longer paper](paper/243/erdos243-reciprocal-tail-reasoning-surface.pdf).
  After Koizumi's normalised vanishing, a bounded or summably small negative
  centred error forces eventual Sylvester recurrence. The unbounded mixed-sign
  regime remains open. Duverney (2001) and the Tao–Kovac line are prior art
  on the page; cubic-rate vanishing is not claimed as empty-page news.
- **[#249](https://www.erdosproblems.com/249)** · Binary totient series ·
  [short paper](paper/249/erdos-249-binary-totient-series.pdf) ·
  [longer paper](paper/249/erdos249-totient-reasoning-surface.pdf).
  Exact dyadic-kernel rank `2^e + 1`, denominator exclusion to about
  `7.96 × 10³⁴`, diagonal certificates through `t ≤ 82`, and no-go theorems
  for the shortcuts. This is not an infinite witness for irrationality.
- **[#251](https://www.erdosproblems.com/251)** · Prime-gap dyadic series ·
  [short paper](paper/251/erdos-251-prime-gap-dyadic-series.pdf) ·
  [longer paper](paper/251/erdos251-prime-gap-reasoning-surface.pdf).
  The strongest supported lead is a coefficient-only countermodel and a sparse
  rationalising perturbation. The prime-to-gap identity is already Tao's
  (summation by parts on the forum, 7 October 2025); this checkout checks it
  without the prime-number theorem. The cofinal small-mismatch tail witness
  remains open.
- **[#257](https://www.erdosproblems.com/257)** · Mersenne-support subseries ·
  [short paper](paper/257/erdos-257-mersenne-support-subseries.pdf) ·
  [longer paper](paper/257/erdos257-mersenne-reasoning-surface.pdf).
  Full-support irrationality in every integer base `b ≥ 2` is Lean.
  Pairwise-coprime plus summable-reciprocal support is Lean. A
  reciprocal-summable theorem without coprimality is ordinary in the short
  paper. Arbitrary infinite support, and the `1/2` and `1/21` branches, remain
  open and are kept distinct from those theorems.
- **[#269](https://www.erdosproblems.com/269)** · Three-prime running LCM ·
  [short paper](paper/269/erdos-269-three-prime-running-lcm.pdf) ·
  [longer paper](paper/269/erdos269-running-lcm-reasoning-surface.pdf).
  Three-prime height identity, nonsingular kernel minors, and the `(2,3,5)`
  minor `-1/15`. The two-prime transcendence argument is Steve Fan's
  ([erdosproblems.com/269](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/269),
  26 June 2026); no priority or Lean theorem is claimed for that. Three or
  more primes remain open.
- **[#1041](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1041)** · Lemniscates and Newton flow ·
  [short paper](paper/1041/erdos-1041-lemniscate-newton-flow.pdf) ·
  [longer paper](paper/1041/erdos1041-lemniscate-reasoning-surface.pdf).
  Newton-flow decay, ray-separating translations, and perturbative root
  retention are Lean. Three solved-family kernels are Comparator-checked.
  All-degree trinomials, the `13/25` certificate, the Poisson mean, and the
  length-`<2` assemblies are ordinary. Forum discussion of a degree-7
  counterexample is not a theorem of this repository.
- **[#1049](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1049)** · Rational-base Lambert series ·
  [short paper](paper/1049/erdos-1049-rational-base-lambert.pdf) ·
  [longer paper](paper/1049/erdos1049-rational-base-lambert-reasoning-surface.pdf).
  An ordinary specialization of Zudilin 2004 proves `F(31/4)` (and its positive
  powers) irrational; that headline is not a Lean theorem. Lean checks
  supporting height-region arithmetic, the `3/2` corridor exclusion, the
  cleared-tail recurrence, and selected Hankel identities. The outstanding
  `3/2` obligation is an approximant family with remainder control.

The [joint #249/#257 manuscript](paper/archive/erdos249-257-main-paper.pdf) is
archive and provenance only; the papers above are the current entrances.

## What the checks establish

Three things come between a Lean proof and a claim in this repo. The
[comprehension graph](docs/semantic/README.md) is the map: every declaration in
the atlas, the statements they make, and typed relations between them, so a
theorem can be seen as a reformulation or finite instance of the open problem
rather than the problem itself. Comparator is a second formal check of the 47
selected interfaces recorded in [`formalization.yaml`](formalization.yaml): each
is declared again without its proof, then checked against a proof-bearing
solution and a fixed axiom budget. The public wording is
Comparator-checked against a separately declared statement and axiom budget.
The [verification dossier](docs/EXTERNAL_VERIFICATION.md) covers all eight
problem programmes. Do not infer results from private or unreleased work.

The [methodology](METHODOLOGY.md) outlines what each check does and does not
establish. [`docs/claims.json`](docs/claims.json) covers claim status and
[prior art](docs/PRIOR_ART.md) records earlier and subsuming work. None of it
decides whether a statement captures the intended problem, is new, or solves
anything, which requires expert review.

Two papers explain the design. [Problem-Sized Lean Worlds](paper/systems/claim-faithful-publication-systems-paper.pdf)
is how finding a result, checking it and deciding what may be claimed are kept
separate. [From Spare Compute to Cumulative Mathematics](paper/systems/open-source-mathematics-strategy.pdf)
is why the work is public and how credit is recorded.

## Contribute

An idea, a correction, a counterexample, a failed route with a checkable
reason, clearer exposition, a validation of a claim or a repaired check all
count. Open the
[plain-language research-progress form](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/issues/new?template=research_progress.yml)
or a pull request. Accepted work gets a public receipt. The
[credit policy](docs/research-commons/CREDIT_POLICY.md) gives the exact
boundary. You can also email me.

## Read or verify locally

- **Read** a problem in [A reader's way in](HUMAN_ENTRY.md).
- **Check** a stated result with the claim verifier in
  [REPRODUCIBILITY](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md).
- **Continue** from one exact public revision via the
  [frontier relay](docs/FRONTIER_RELAY.md) and [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Experts:** [email me](https://wcook04.github.io/plectis/#contact) any
  insight. I will do the work and fully credit you.

Every command lives in [REPRODUCIBILITY](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md) and the
[agent workbench](docs/AGENT_WORKBENCH.md): claim verifier, reader-only and
quick Lean checkouts, complete proof source, full release replay.
[ARCHITECTURE](ARCHITECTURE.md) and the [source map](docs/SOURCE_MAP.md)
assume no Lean and no project history.

Cloning runs no project code; there are no submodules, Git LFS filters or
hooks. Proof builds run the pinned Lean toolchain and Mathlib.
[SECURITY](SECURITY.md) explains the boundary.
Agents arriving cold start at [`AGENTS.override.md`](AGENTS.override.md); the
[agent-navigation paper](paper/systems/cold-clone-to-proof-receipt.pdf) explains that design.

## Corpus at a glance

The reviewed layer a mathematician should judge: 140 curated claim records in 30 contribution families, reaching Lean source through 449 principal declaration links. `SCOPE.md` gives its shape and `docs/RESULTS.md` gives the strongest checked result per problem. The website and the papers are the human reading path.

The rest is engineering inventory. About 91% of the 156,245 declarations (142,668 across 695 modules) are machine-emitted certificate shards: one integer checked prime, one position excluded. The remainder is not all hand-written either.

| Engineering inventory | Current size |
|---|---:|
| Lean modules (the two library roots) | 1,274 |
| Formal results and supporting lemmas | 153,502 |
| Curated claim records | 140 |
| Contribution families | 30 |

Generated shards are counted as formal source and never as separate
mathematical claims. Claim records cover every status, including cited and
open, and are partitioned once.
These are navigation counts, not novelty claims. They still need expert validation.

## Following a result into Lean

The paper links each headline result to the relevant source. For a particular
topic, start with the [source map](docs/SOURCE_MAP.md); it gives the module
order without asking you to decode Lean declaration names first.
