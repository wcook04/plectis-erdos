# Trusted challenge for the Erdős #68 channel-radius obstruction

This Mathlib-only statement isolates the quantitative endpoint of the finite
channel method.  If a positive moment is divisible by every channel modulus
through `D = 2t²` and remains below `(R+1)!-1`, then the support radius is at
least cubic in `t`.  Two constants are recorded: `3t³ < 2(R+1)` from
`t ≥ 2^32`, and the coarser `t³ < 8(R+1)` from `t ≥ 4096`.  The sequence
statements record the corresponding eventual no-go for each constant and a
little-o obstruction.

The last theorem is a statement about the finite logarithmic constraint
itself, not about the series and not about the radius.  It evaluates that
constraint at `R+1 = (16/9)t³` and shows the constraint holds there, so the
constraint alone does not force a lower bound at that constant.  It asserts
no bound on any support radius.

The hypotheses are explicit.  No theorem here constructs these moments from
the factorial-gap series or proves that its channels vanish, so the package
does not solve Erdős Problem 68.
