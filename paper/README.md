# Papers

Each of the eight covered Erdős problems has a short first-read paper and a
longer complete reasoning record. Start with the short paper for the result,
its argument and the question that remains. Use the longer record when you
want to recover a detailed step, inspect a computation, or follow an approach
that stopped. You do not need Lean or a coding agent to read either.

Using the degree-seven polynomial constructed by the erdosproblems.com
contributor ani, Lean proves that every preconnected strict-lemniscate set
containing two distinct roots has one-dimensional Hausdorff measure greater
than two. This refutes the exact Formal Conjectures path-image-length
statement; the separate total-variation bound is also checked. The other
seven targets remain open. Independent human review of correspondence with
the 1958 wording has not been recorded. Comparator checks only selected exact
statements, axioms and kernel acceptance; it does not assess novelty or
historical correspondence. The papers report partial results, failed or
equivalent routes, finite evidence, and the exact obligations that survive.
If the problem numbers or formalisation are unfamiliar, read
[a reader's way in](../docs/README.md) first. For the design of the tools
and the research process, go to the [project papers](#project-papers).

The #243 short paper leads with irrationality under the cubic rate
`a_n²/a_(n+1) = 1 + 3/n + o(n⁻³)` for strictly increasing positive integer
sequences. Its bounded-increment criterion for an eventual Sylvester tail is
a second result; the unrestricted problem remains open. The #1049 short
paper proves a rational-base sufficient region using Zudilin's forms after
cyclotomic cancellation and denominator accounting. Its region contains
`31/4`, which is outside the earlier Bundschuh–Väänänen sufficient region;
`3/2` remains open.

## Reading the eight together

One cross-problem paper develops the mathematics that arises from reading the
programmes together. For `c>0` and integers `d≥1`, it considers entire functions
`f(z) = ∑_(n≥1) e_n z^n/n!` with nonnegative integer `e_n` eventually bounded
by `n^c` and, for each fixed positive integer `q`, eventually divisible by `q`.
The set of derivative-value vectors at `1` has Hausdorff dimension `min(c,d)` and
contains an open set exactly when `c>d`. This result has an ordinary proof with the formal ingredients
identified separately. The paper also contains the capacity and congruence
criterion, Lambert-subsum results, exact computations and method limits.

[Reading Eight Erdős Problems Together](synthesis/optimal-sparse-perturbations.pdf)
([source](synthesis/optimal-sparse-perturbations.tex)).

## Follow the argument into its evidence

Read the assumptions of the result you want to use, then the proof. The
longer record gives the surrounding working context, including routes that
failed, finite experiments and open obligations. If you cannot reconstruct a
step or find its source, that is useful feedback through
[Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

Some results are checked in Lean; others are ordinary mathematical arguments
or applications of cited external theorems. Each paper states the boundary for
its own claims. [Results and limits](../docs/RESULTS.md) gives the result beside
what remains open, and the [source map](../docs/reference/SOURCE_MAP.md) connects the
paper to supporting declarations. Lean files are proof authority only for the
exact declarations they check; [`docs/claims.json`](../docs/claims.json)
records the selected public claim interfaces.

The [full-text index](../docs/papers/README.md) provides generated Markdown
versions for browsing. The PDFs and `.tex` files above are the authored
manuscripts. The older joint #249/#257 paper is retained for provenance;
it is not the entry point for either problem.

## Project papers

Start with [A Repository-Based System for Research and Publication](systems/claim-faithful-publication-systems-paper.pdf)
([source](systems/claim-faithful-publication-systems-paper.tex)). This is the main
systems paper: it follows a result from its mathematical argument through
formal support, written explanation, review and contribution.

Two earlier papers are retained as historical background. Their account is
superseded by the main paper; their observations and cross-references belong
to the revisions they describe.

| Earlier paper | Detail retained |
|---|---|
| [From a Cold Clone to a Proof Receipt](systems/cold-clone-to-proof-receipt.pdf) ([source](systems/cold-clone-to-proof-receipt.tex)) | Navigation, recorded proof checks and incremental validation. |
| [From Spare Compute to Cumulative Mathematics](systems/open-source-mathematics-strategy.pdf) ([source](systems/open-source-mathematics-strategy.tex)) | Contribution protocol, compute, credit and governance. |

For current use, follow [the reading guide](../docs/README.md),

<summary>Source note for the #251 sparse construction</summary>

For #251, [the results guide](../docs/RESULTS.md#strongest-checked-results-by-problem)
identifies the formal sparse construction and the differences in quantifier
order between it and the printed proof. The short paper's attribution section
explains those differences before its source index.

### Returning from a problem note to checked evidence

The notes are exposition, not proof authority.  To return from any note to the
machine-owned problem record, run the matching route below.  Each problem route
returns its exact paper/source record, checked module inventory, and open
obligation handles; the [complete eight-problem source map](../docs/reference/SOURCE_MAP.md#complete-eight-problem-return-matrix)
keeps the same joins readable.  For a source-fingerprinted continuation packet,
use the route-memory command in the last column.

| Problem | Public problem route | Resumable route-memory handoff |
|---|---|---|
| #68 | `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --route erdos_68` | `python3 scripts/query_route_memory.py --problem 68` |
| #243 | `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --route erdos_243` | `python3 scripts/query_route_memory.py --problem 243` |
| #249 | `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --route erdos_249` | `python3 scripts/query_route_memory.py --problem 249` |
| #251 | `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --route erdos_251` | `python3 scripts/query_route_memory.py --problem 251` |
| #257 | `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --route erdos_257` | `python3 scripts/query_route_memory.py --problem 257` |
| #269 | `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --route erdos_269` | `python3 scripts/query_route_memory.py --problem 269` |
| #1041 | `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --route erdos_1041` | `python3 scripts/query_route_memory.py --problem 1041` |
| #1049 | `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --route erdos_1049` | `python3 scripts/query_route_memory.py --problem 1049` |

## Build and update

Run from the repository root, with Tectonic or a TeX Live installation:

```sh
make -C paper
```

The Makefile builds the manuscripts registered in
[`docs/publication_contract.json`](../docs/publication_contract.json) and
copies the PDFs into their problem or systems directory under `paper/`.
The temporary build PDFs in `paper/` are not the published copies.

To rebuild one paper, run `make -C paper <stem>.pdf` and then
`python3 scripts/sync_publication_pdfs.py`, which copies the fresh PDF into
place. Each copy is recorded in [`build-manifest.json`](build-manifest.json)
with the digest of the PDF and of every TeX input it was compiled from, and a
build output older than one of its inputs is refused. The release checks fail
when a committed PDF is not the recorded build of its committed inputs.

The problem PDFs also depend on their generated evidence links. Tectonic keeps
the `.aux` files so that, after a layout change, the evidence builder can read
the current result numbers and pages:

```sh
python3 scripts/paper_evidence.py build --corpus-repo /path/to/plectis-erdos-lean \
  --aux-dir paper --aux-paper <paper-id>
```

Review and commit changed evidence records before pointing that paper's
`record_commit_overrides` entry in `evidence/config.json` at the new commit.
Run the evidence builder again, rebuild the affected PDF and synchronize it.
`python3 scripts/check_paper_evidence_pdfs.py` checks each margin link against
the heading and page in the resulting PDF; `make -C paper check` includes
this check. It needs the dependencies in `scripts/requirements-release.txt`.

After editing a manuscript, rebuild its PDF before updating its recorded
digests. The following command previews digest changes; add `--apply` only
after reviewing the source and rebuilt PDF:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_publication_contract.py --restamp
```

The statement links inside a paper identify the exact proof-source revision
used for that paper. They serve reproducibility. They are not a reason to
keep an older manuscript on the reading path. When the source changes, update
the explanation and source links together, rebuild the PDF, and check its
coverage against the current proofs:

```sh
python3 scripts/check_problem_note_sources.py --coverage
python3 scripts/papers/check_paper_corpus.py
```

The last check rejects a Markdown mirror or recorded PDF that no longer
matches its manuscript. Include the edited source, rebuilt PDF and check
output in your pull request. If the remaining failure is a generated copy
made stale by your manuscript edit, say so in the pull request; do not
hand-edit the copy to make the check pass.

Refresh generated full text and paper-corpus records with
`python3 scripts/papers/refresh_paper_corpus.py --write`, then run
`python3 scripts/refresh_projections.py` and
`python3 scripts/papers/check_paper_corpus.py` before merging. These owners are
included in the public checkout; do not edit their generated output by hand.

## Maintain the publication library

[Choose a problem on the website](https://wcook04.github.io/plectis/maths/).
Every problem has a short paper, a long paper, and a searchable source map.
PDF and TeX links point to stable file paths on this repository's `main` branch.
The website's HTML reader is a published snapshot.

`docs/problem_library.json` is the public machine-readable source for that view.
It is separate from the bounded `docs/problems.json` entry index. Each problem
contains `papers`, `paper_roles`, and a `source_map` with module nodes and import
edges. Import arrows describe source dependencies, not theorem strength or
mathematical credit. Only local Lean modules are included.

To refresh the library after changing source or paper records, run from a full
checkout (the reader-only sparse checkout intentionally omits Lean source):

```sh
python3 scripts/build_problem_index.py
python3 scripts/build_problem_index.py --check
python3 scripts/tests/test_problem_library.py
```

Paper identities and short/long roles come from `docs/papers/corpus.json`.
Keep a paper's `paper_id` and file paths when revising it; rebuild and commit its
PDF with the TeX source. Title and page-count changes do not change its URL.
When adding a paper, its corpus record needs explicit problem membership
(`problem_ids`, or its existing numbered `subject`), publication state, form,
and paths to the PDF, TeX, and full text. Missing files fail the build.
The long manuscripts are assembled from `paper/reasoning-parts/`; use
`python3 scripts/assemble_reasoning_surfaces.py --check` to check agreement.

Source-map roots come from each problem directory, principal and companion
modules, reviewed result sources, and explicitly linked claims. The builder
reads actual Lean imports and follows their local dependencies recursively.
Each node carries its source digest and current GitHub URL; the library records
input digests so consumers can reject a mismatched claim snapshot.
