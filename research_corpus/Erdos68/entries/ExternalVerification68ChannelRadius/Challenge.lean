# Trusted challenge for the Erdős #68 channel-radius obstruction

This Mathlib-only statement isolates the quantitative endpoint of the finite
channel method.  If a positive moment is divisible by every channel modulus
through `D = 2t²` and remains below `(R+1)!-1`, then the support radius is at
least cubic in `t`.  The sequence statements record the corresponding sharp
eventual no-go and a coarser little-o obstruction.

The hypotheses are explicit.  No theorem here constructs these moments from
the factorial-gap series or proves that its channels vanish, so the package
does not solve Erdős Problem 68.
