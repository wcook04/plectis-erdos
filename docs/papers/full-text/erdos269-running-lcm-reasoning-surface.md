# The Three-Prime Running LCM: Complete Reasoning Record

<div class="center">

<span class="smallcaps">Abstract</span>

</div>

The three-prime reciprocal running-LCM kernel has nonsingular minors of every order, uniformly in its third-coordinate layer. A binary floor carry explains its non-separability, exact sampled ranks and sharp uniform approximation obstruction. This is compatible with finite-rank approximation of the original kernel in the summation norm. For the repeated $`\{2,3,5\}`$ series we derive the literal integer tail recurrence, two quadratic bounds, exact denominator clearing and a residue-escape equivalence for dominating caps of size $`o(8^a)`$. We sharpen the fixed-start residue description and isolate the moving boundary in a value-preserving weighted difference; a literal counterexample shows that absence of floor crossings alone does not force cancellation. No cofinal escape or irrationality theorem is proved for this series. The two-prime comparison reproduces the earlier reduction attributed to Steve Fan, using the classical Hecke–Mahler value theorem. Ordinary proofs, external analytic inputs, supplied formal receipts and finite computations are kept separate.

#### How the short paper uses this record.

The short paper centres on the binary carry and its rank obstruction. Section <a href="#long269:sec:rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:rank">4</a> gives the rank and approximation arguments; Section <a href="#long269:sec:two-prime" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:two-prime">3</a> gives the two-prime comparison. Sections <a href="#long269:sec:blocks" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:blocks">5</a>–<a href="#long269:sec:escape" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:escape">7</a> recover the literal tails, denominator clearing and window criterion, while Section <a href="#long269:sec:evidence" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:evidence">8</a> retains the finite certificates. These are two distinct mathematical tasks: the rank argument excludes a separated representation, and the tail argument identifies the arithmetic condition still needed for irrationality. Neither substitutes for the other.

# The problem, and what is settled

Let $`P`$ be a finite set of primes with $`|P|\ge2`$, and let $`a_1<a_2<\cdots`$ enumerate the positive integers all of whose prime factors lie in $`P`$. Erdős Problem #269 asks whether
``` math
\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{1}{[a_1,\ldots,a_n]}
```
is irrational, where $`[a_1,\ldots,a_n]`$ is the least common multiple \[erdosgraham1980, p. 65\]\[erdos1988, p. 106\]. Bloom’s catalogue is the source of the problem number and the status recorded in the cited snapshot \[erdosproblems\]. This revision does not make a new claim about the live catalogue status. Theorem <a href="#long269:res:lead-two-prime" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:lead-two-prime">1</a> settles every instance with $`|P|=2`$, at the level of transcendence, and Fan posted that argument first \[fan2026comment\]; this record leaves the repeated finite cases with $`|P|\ge3`$ unresolved.

The restriction $`|P|\ge2`$ is necessary. For $`P=\{p\}`$ the enumeration is $`a_n=p^{\,n-1}`$, so $`[a_1,\ldots,a_n]=p^{\,n-1}`$ and the sum is $`p/(p-1)`$. For infinite $`P`$ the sum is always irrational, which Erdős calls a simple exercise \[erdos1988, p. 106\].

Write $`\mathcal R_P`$ for the sum above and $`\mathcal D_P`$ for the de-duplicated sum, in which each distinct value of the running least common multiple contributes its reciprocal once. The two differ because the running value is constant along stretches of the enumeration. In a letter written on 1 January 1973 Erdős recorded that he could prove irrationality of the de-duplicated sum \[erdos1974letter, p. 335\]. He states that assertion for given primes $`p_1,\ldots,p_r`$ and supplies no proof; for a single prime the de-duplicated sum is again $`p/(p-1)`$, so the assertion concerns sets of at least two primes. The open question addressed by the catalogue is $`\mathcal R_P`$; its two-prime case is Theorem <a href="#long269:res:lead-two-prime" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:lead-two-prime">1</a>.

<div id="long269:res:lead-two-prime" class="theorem">

**Theorem 1** (two-prime transcendence). *Let $`p`$ and $`q`$ be distinct primes. Then $`\mathcal R_{\{p,q\}}`$ and $`\mathcal D_{\{p,q\}}`$ are transcendental.*

</div>

Section <a href="#long269:sec:two-prime" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:two-prime">3</a> proves this. Both values are nonconstant polynomials over $`\mathbb Q`$ in one Hecke–Mahler boundary sum $`A`$, and transcendence of $`A`$ is the theorem of Loxton and van der Poorten \[loxtonvdp1977, Theorem 8, p. 40\] in the modern form of Bugeaud and Laurent \[bugeaudlaurent2023, Theorem 1.1\]. The evidence class is an ordinary proof in this paper over a cited external theorem, and no Lean declaration formalises it.

#### Attribution.

The supplied forum record credits Steve Fan’s post of 26 June 2026 with the running-LCM identity for finite prime sets, the two-channel factorisation, the Hecke–Mahler reduction and its transcendence conclusion \[fan2026comment\]. The unrestricted analogue is classical: iterating the prime-exponent maximum rule gives $`\operatorname{lcm}(1,\ldots,N)=\prod_{t\le N}t^{\lfloor\log_t N\rfloor}`$ over the primes $`t\le N`$, equivalently $`\log\operatorname{lcm}(1,\ldots,N)=\psi(N)`$; see Apostol \[apostol1976\] and Montgomery and Vaughan \[montgomeryvaughan2007\]. We reproduce that argument to fix normalisations and distinguish repeated from distinct-height sums, not as a new application of the value theorem. The live thread was inaccessible during this revision; priority is retained from the supplied record rather than re-presented as independently verified correspondence. The scalar transcendence theorem itself is credited separately to its published authors.

#### What the third prime does.

Section <a href="#long269:sec:rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:rank">4</a> isolates the obstruction exactly. After separating row and column factors, the two-prime kernel is an outer product and the three-prime kernel retains one binary floor carry. That carry is enough to produce nonsingular minors of every order, uniformly in the third coordinate, and to make the normalised carry matrix inapproximable by finite separated sums below half its own jump. The minors use only row and column rescaling, the density of the rotations by $`\log_rp`$ and $`\log_rq`$ taken separately, and a staircase determinant, and one choice of indices serves every layer of the literal kernel. Sections <a href="#long269:sec:blocks" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:blocks">5</a> to <a href="#long269:sec:escape" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:escape">7</a> take a second route on the literal $`\{2,3,5\}`$ series: dyadic shells give an integer-coefficient tail recurrence, a strict endpoint clears the smooth part of a hypothetical denominator, and the surviving carry is trapped between a quadratic bound and a residue condition. Section <a href="#long269:sec:evidence" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:evidence">8</a> reports the finite evidence and its ceiling, and Section <a href="#long269:sec:open" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:open">9</a> states what remains.

Throughout, $`p,q,r`$ are pairwise distinct primes. Call $`n`$ *smooth* when $`n=p^{i}q^{j}r^{k}`$ for some $`i,j,k\ge0`$; this is the smooth lattice value. For $`x\ge1`$ write
``` math
\operatorname{L}(x)=\operatorname{lcm}\{\,n\le x:\ n\ \text{smooth}\,\},
 \qquad
 \operatorname{H}(x)=p^{\lfloor\log_p x\rfloor}\,q^{\lfloor\log_q x\rfloor}\,
 r^{\lfloor\log_r x\rfloor},
```
the running least common multiple and the pure-power height, where $`\lfloor\log_b x\rfloor`$ is the largest $`e`$ with $`b^{e}\le x`$. Since $`a_1,\ldots,a_n`$ are exactly the smooth numbers up to $`a_n`$, we have $`[a_1,\ldots,a_n]=\operatorname{L}(a_n)`$. The reciprocal of the height at a smooth point is the lattice kernel
``` math
\operatorname{K}(i,j,k)=\frac{1}{\operatorname{H}(p^{i}q^{j}r^{k})} .
```
Here “smooth” always means supported on the fixed prime set, and it is not the varying-bound notion counted by $`\Psi(x,y)`$ in the Dickman–Hildebrand theory \[hildebrand1986\]; no smooth-number density asymptotic is used below. The appropriate fixed-support context is Tijdeman–Meijer \[tijdemanmeijer1974, Sections 1–4\]. The modern two-prime treatment of Languasco, Luca, Moree and Togbé \[languasco2025\] also makes the lattice-triangle geometry explicit; its gap estimates are not inputs to our shell bound. For $`b\in\{p,q,r\}`$ the set of positive powers of $`b`$ is the *$`b`$-channel*.

The statement of Problem #269 has been formalised before, as a conjecture with an unfilled proof, in the *Formal Conjectures* collection \[formalconjectures269\]. That is a formal statement of the question up to a rational normalisation, since its Nat-indexed series includes the empty-prefix term, and its rational, irrational and infinite-prime assertions all end in `sorry`. Kovač and Tao \[kovactao2024\] treat several irrationality problems of Erdős for series of unit fractions by elementary means; nothing from that work is used here.

<a id="notation-and-proof-dependencies"></a>

## Notation and proof dependencies

There are two different sums: $`\mathcal R_P`$ counts every supported integer, whereas $`\mathcal D_P`$ counts each height once. From the dyadic section onwards, $`S=\mathcal R_{\{2,3,5\}}`$. Write $`P_a=\operatorname{H}(2^a)`$, $`h_a=P_a/2`$, $`s_a`$ for the shell mass and $`X_a=h_a\sum_{j\ge a}s_j`$. Thus $`P_a`$ is a boundary height, not a set of primes. The long record’s $`U_a`$ is the short note’s $`T_a`$. The cumulative jump count is $`n_a=a+\lfloor a\log_3 2\rfloor+\lfloor a\log_5 2\rfloor`$; the strict index is $`j_a=n_a-1`$ for $`a\ge1`$. The long cap is $`K(B,a)=\lfloor BQ(n_a)\rfloor`$, while the short note uses $`K_0(B,a)=90B(a+1)^2`$. Neither is a residue or a hypothetical integer carry. A window has start $`\ell`$, length $`h`$, product $`W_{\ell,h}`$ and forcing $`F_{\ell,h}`$; zero modulo $`W`$ is represented by $`W`$, not zero.

The rank proof uses only diagonal rescaling and separate one-dimensional density. The arithmetic proof instead uses the actual shell coefficients: summability $`\to`$ recurrence $`\to`$ denominator clearing $`\to`$ the residue criterion. The weighted-shift discussion is a third route, with explicit unproved cancellation hypotheses. No arrow from kernel rank to scalar irrationality is asserted.

# The finite geometry of the running value

The smooth numbers up to $`x`$ are indexed by the exponent triples $`(i,j,k)`$ with $`i\le\lfloor\log_p x\rfloor`$, $`j\le\lfloor\log_q x\rfloor`$, $`k\le\lfloor\log_r x\rfloor`$ and $`p^{i}q^{j}r^{k}\le x`$, the smooth prefix index set. Both conditions matter: the coordinate box is strictly larger than the prefix, since a product of three large pure powers can exceed $`x`$ while each factor does not.

<div id="long269:res:lcm" class="theorem">

**Theorem 2** (the running least common multiple). *Let $`p,q,r`$ be pairwise distinct primes and $`x\ge1`$. Then $`\operatorname{L}(x)=\operatorname{H}(x)`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Every smooth $`n\le x`$ has exponents bounded by the corresponding integer logarithms, so $`n\mid\operatorname{H}(x)`$ and hence $`\operatorname{L}(x)\mid\operatorname{H}(x)`$. Conversely the three pure powers $`p^{\lfloor\log_p x\rfloor}`$, $`q^{\lfloor\log_q x\rfloor}`$ and $`r^{\lfloor\log_r x\rfloor}`$ are themselves smooth numbers not exceeding $`x`$, so each divides $`\operatorname{L}(x)`$, and distinct primes have coprime powers, so their product divides $`\operatorname{L}(x)`$ as well. ◻

</div>

At $`(p,q,r)=(2,3,5)`$ the first ten values are
``` math
\begin{array}{c|cccccccccc}
x&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10\\ \hline
\operatorname{L}(x)&1&2&6&12&60&60&60&120&360&360
\end{array}
```
So $`\operatorname{L}(6)=4\cdot3\cdot5=60`$, which exceeds $`6`$: the running value at a smooth cutoff already contains powers of the other two primes that the cutoff itself does not. That small fact is the mechanism behind Section <a href="#long269:sec:rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:rank">4</a>. Also $`\operatorname{H}(x)\le x^{3}`$, since each of the three factors is a power of its base not exceeding $`x`$; this is the cubic majorant, and the exponent is the number of generating primes.

Say that $`x`$ and $`y`$ lie in the same *logarithmic cell* when $`\lfloor\log_b x\rfloor=\lfloor\log_b y\rfloor`$ for each of $`b=p,q,r`$, the cell relation. By Theorem <a href="#long269:res:lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:lcm">2</a> the running value depends on $`x`$ only through the three integer logarithms, so it is constant on cells and moves only where one logarithm moves.

<div id="long269:res:cell" class="proposition">

**Proposition 3** (constancy and jump ratios). *If $`x,y\ge1`$ lie in the same logarithmic cell then $`\operatorname{L}(x)=\operatorname{L}(y)`$, and the same holds for the kernel at two smooth points of one cell. If $`\lfloor\log_p y\rfloor=\lfloor\log_p x\rfloor+1`$ while the other two logarithms agree, then $`\operatorname{L}(y)=p\,\operatorname{L}(x)`$, and similarly with $`q`$ or $`r`$ in place of $`p`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Both parts are immediate from Theorem <a href="#long269:res:lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:lcm">2</a>: the height depends on $`x`$ only through the three integer logarithms, and advancing one of them multiplies exactly one factor by its base. ◻

<span id="long269:res:jump" label="long269:res:jump"></span>

<div id="long269:res:count" class="proposition">

**Proposition 4** (jump count). *Let $`n\ge0`$. The set of the first $`n`$ positive powers of $`p`$, of $`q`$ and of $`r`$ has exactly $`3n`$ elements, and adjoining the common origin $`1`$ gives exactly $`3n+1`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Within one channel the powers $`b,b^{2},\ldots,b^{n}`$ are distinct because $`b\ge2`$. Across two channels a common value would be a positive power of two distinct primes, which unique factorisation forbids. Finally $`1`$ is not a positive power of any prime. ◻

</div>

Two finite statements are recorded here because they are the exact shape of the counting used later. Write $`\mathcal B(h_p,h_q,h_r)`$ for the box of exponent triples with $`i\le h_p`$, $`j\le h_q`$, $`k\le h_r`$, the exponent box, and $`F(H)`$ for the set of its points whose height equals $`H`$, the height fibre.

<div id="long269:res:fibre" class="proposition">

**Proposition 5** (finite normal form). *For every box $`\mathcal B`$, $`\sum_{(i,j,k)\in\mathcal B}\operatorname{K}(i,j,k)=\sum_{H}\#F(H)/H`$, the outer sum ranging over the heights attained on $`\mathcal B`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Partition $`\mathcal B`$ into the fibres of the height map. On $`F(H)`$ every summand is $`1/H`$, so the fibre contributes $`\#F(H)/H`$. ◻

</div>

Now fix an interval $`[\lambda,\eta)`$ and write $`\mathcal S`$ for the exponent triples of $`\mathcal B(h_p,h_q,h_r)`$ whose smooth value lies in it, the smooth exponent shell.

<div id="long269:res:short" class="lemma">

**Lemma 6** (uniqueness in a short interval). *Let $`b\ge1`$ and $`\eta\le b\,\lambda`$. If $`b^{a}w`$ and $`b^{a'}w`$ both lie in $`[\lambda,\eta)`$ then $`a=a'`$.*

<div class="proof">

**Proposition 7** (projection and the quadratic shell bound). *<span id="long269:res:shell" label="long269:res:shell"></span> If $`\eta\le r\,\lambda`$ then $`\#\mathcal S\le(h_p+1)(h_q+1)`$, and if $`\eta\le p\,\lambda`$ then $`\#\mathcal S\le(h_q+1)(h_r+1)`$. If moreover $`\eta\le r\,\lambda`$ and $`h_p\le h_q\le h_r`$ with $`h_p+h_q+h_r=j`$, then $`9\,\#\mathcal S\le(j+3)^{2}`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Suppose $`\eta\le r\,\lambda`$. If two triples of $`\mathcal S`$ agree in their first two coordinates, Lemma <a href="#long269:res:short" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:short">6</a> with $`b=r`$ and $`w=p^{i}q^{j}`$ forces their third coordinates to agree, so the projection forgetting the third coordinate is injective on $`\mathcal S`$ and its image lies in a rectangle with $`(h_p+1)(h_q+1)`$ points. The other case is the same with the first coordinate projected away. Under the sorting hypothesis the two surviving coordinates are the two smallest, so it suffices that $`a\le b\le c`$ with $`a+b+c=j`$ gives $`9(a+1)(b+1)\le(j+3)^{2}`$. From $`a\le b\le c`$ we get $`a+2b\le j`$, so it is enough that $`9(a+1)(b+1)\le(a+2b+3)^{2}`$; writing $`b=a+d`$ with $`d\ge0`$, the difference of the two sides is $`d(3a+4d+3)\ge0`$. ◻

# One Hecke–Mahler value controls both two-prime sums

Temporarily let $`P=\{p,q\}`$ with $`p<q`$, and write $`L_{p,q}(t)=p^{\lfloor\log_p t\rfloor}q^{\lfloor\log_q t\rfloor}`$, which is the running least common multiple of the $`\{p,q\}`$-smooth numbers up to $`t`$ by the argument of Theorem <a href="#long269:res:lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:lcm">2</a> with one coordinate omitted. The de-duplicated sum retains the initial value $`1`$ and one reciprocal for every later distinct running value, so
``` math
\mathcal D_{\{p,q\}}
 =1+\sum_{t\in\{p,p^2,\ldots\}\cup\{q,q^2,\ldots\}}\frac1{L_{p,q}(t)},
 \qquad
 \mathcal R_{\{p,q\}}=\sum_{i,j\ge0}\frac1{L_{p,q}(p^iq^j)} .
```

<div class="proof">

*Proof of Theorem <a href="#long269:res:lead-two-prime" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:lead-two-prime">1</a>.* Set
``` math
\theta=\frac{\log p}{\log q},\qquad x=\frac1p,\qquad y=\frac1q,\qquad
 m_n=\lfloor n\theta\rfloor,\qquad \delta_n=m_{n+1}-m_n .
```
Here $`0<\theta<1`$, and $`\theta`$ is irrational, since a rational value would give $`p^{b}=q^{a}`$ for positive integers $`a,b`$. Consequently $`\delta_n\in\{0,1\}`$. Put
``` math
A=\sum_{n\ge0}x^ny^{m_n},
 \qquad
 B_\ast=\sum_{n\ge0}\delta_nx^ny^{m_n+1} .
```
The initial value and the $`p`$-channel contribute $`A`$, since $`L_{p,q}(p^n)=p^nq^{m_n}`$. A power of $`q`$ lies strictly between $`p^n`$ and $`p^{n+1}`$ exactly when $`\delta_n=1`$, it is then $`q^{m_n+1}`$, and its post-jump reciprocal is $`x^ny^{m_n+1}`$; so the $`q`$-channel contributes $`B_\ast`$ and $`\mathcal D_{\{p,q\}}=A+B_\ast`$. All these series converge absolutely.

Since $`y^{m_{n+1}}-y^{m_n}=\delta_ny^{m_n}(y-1)`$, an index shift gives $`A-1-xA=x(y-1)B_\ast/y`$, so $`B_\ast=\bigl((p-1)A-p\bigr)/(1-q)`$ and
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:two-prime-affine}
 \mathcal D_{\{p,q\}}=\frac{(q-p)A+p}{q-1} .
\end{equation}
```
At a smooth point, $`\log_p(p^iq^j)=i+j/\theta`$ and $`\log_q(p^iq^j)=j+i\theta`$, so $`L_{p,q}(p^iq^j)=p^{\,i+\lfloor j/\theta\rfloor}q^{\,j+m_i}`$ and absolute convergence permits the factorisation
``` math
\mathcal R_{\{p,q\}}=AC,\qquad C=\sum_{j\ge0}y^jx^{\lfloor j/\theta\rfloor}.
```
For $`j\ge1`$ put $`n=\lfloor j/\theta\rfloor`$. Then $`n>j/\theta-1`$ gives $`n\theta>j-\theta>j-1`$, and $`n+1>j/\theta`$ gives $`(n+1)\theta>j`$, while $`n\theta\le j`$ and $`(n+1)\theta<j+\theta<j+1`$; hence $`m_n=j-1`$, $`m_{n+1}=j`$ and $`\delta_n=1`$. Conversely every $`n`$ with $`\delta_n=1`$ arises from the unique $`j=m_{n+1}`$. Therefore $`C=1+B_\ast`$ and
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic}
 \mathcal R_{\{p,q\}}
 =\frac{(p+q-1)A-(p-1)A^{2}}{q-1} .
\end{equation}
```

It remains to prove that $`A`$ is transcendental. For the Hecke–Mahler series
``` math
F_\theta(x,y)=\sum_{n\ge1}\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n\theta\rfloor}x^ny^k
```
a finite geometric sum gives $`\bigl((1-y)/y\bigr)F_\theta(x,y)=x/(1-x)-(A-1)`$, that is
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:hecke-mahler-boundary}
 A=\frac1{1-x}-\frac{1-y}{y}F_\theta(x,y).
\end{equation}
```
Bugeaud and Laurent’s Theorem 1.1 states, in particular, that $`F_\theta(\beta,\alpha)`$ is transcendental when $`\theta\in(0,1)`$ is irrational, $`\alpha`$ and $`\beta`$ are nonzero algebraic numbers, $`|\beta|<1`$ and $`|\beta\alpha^\theta|<1`$ \[bugeaudlaurent2023, Theorem 1.1\]; the $`\rho=0`$ case used here goes back to Loxton and van der Poorten \[loxtonvdp1977, Theorem 8, p. 40\]. Take $`(\beta,\alpha)=(x,y)`$: then $`|\beta|=1/p<1`$ and
``` math
|xy^{\theta}|=\frac1p\left(\frac1q\right)^{\log p/\log q}=\frac1{p^{2}}<1 .
```
So $`F_\theta(x,y)`$ is transcendental, and <a href="#long269:eq:hecke-mahler-boundary" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:hecke-mahler-boundary">[long269:eq:hecke-mahler-boundary]</a> makes $`A`$ transcendental. The coefficient of $`A`$ in <a href="#long269:eq:two-prime-affine" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:two-prime-affine">[long269:eq:two-prime-affine]</a> is $`(q-p)/(q-1)\ne0`$ and the coefficient of $`A^{2}`$ in <a href="#long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic">[long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic]</a> is $`-(p-1)/(q-1)\ne0`$, both rational. If either value were algebraic, its identity would exhibit $`A`$ as a root of a nonzero polynomial over the algebraic numbers. ◻

The two identities are separately labelled <span id="long269:res:two-prime-transcendence" label="long269:res:two-prime-transcendence"></span><span id="long269:res:two-prime-repeated-transcendence" label="long269:res:two-prime-repeated-transcendence"></span> because they carry different weight. A product of two transcendental numbers need not be transcendental, so the factorisation $`\mathcal R=AC`$ alone proves nothing; the quadratic identity <a href="#long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic">[long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic]</a> in the single value $`A`$ is what settles the repeated sum. A third prime replaces the single Beatty boundary by a genuinely two-dimensional ordering problem, and the next section makes that failure exact.

One might hope to write the kernel as $`f(i)g(j)h(k)`$ and reduce the problem to one-dimensional criteria. At two generators that hope is exactly correct, and at three it fails at every finite order.

*Proof.* Since $`i`$ and $`j`$ are integers, $`\lfloor\log_p(p^iq^j)\rfloor=i+\lfloor\log_p q^{j}\rfloor`$ and $`\lfloor\log_q(p^iq^j)\rfloor=j+\lfloor\log_q p^{i}\rfloor`$.

The remaining matrix is independent of $`k`$, and $`x_i+y_j\in[0,2)`$, so its entries are $`1`$ and $`t`$.

Each of $`\alpha`$ and $`\beta`$ is irrational, since a rational value would give an equality of positive powers of distinct primes, so each fractional-part orbit is dense in $`(0,1)`$ and each is injective. No simultaneous density of the pair of rotations is required. First choose indices with $`0<x_{I(0)}<\cdots<x_{I(n-1)}<1`$. For the columns write $`s_b=1-y_{J(b)}`$, and use density of the second orbit to choose
``` math
s_0\in(0,x_{I(0)}),\qquad
 s_b\in(x_{I(b-1)},x_{I(b)})\quad(1\le b<n).
```
The intervals are disjoint, so the $`J(b)`$ are distinct. Their strict endpoints ensure that no selected entry lies on a threshold, and $`x_{I(a)}+y_{J(b)}\ge1`$ holds exactly when $`b\le a`$. Dividing row $`a`$ by $`R_{I(a)}(k)`$ and column $`b`$ by $`C_{J(b)}(k)`$ therefore leaves
``` math
C_n(t)=\begin{pmatrix}
 t&1&1&\cdots&1\\

 \det C_n(t)=t(t-1)^{n-1}\ne0 ,

the determinant following by subtracting from each row its predecessor, working upwards from the last. Before the division, the determinant equals
``` math
\det C_n(t)\prod_{a<n}R_{I(a)}(k)\prod_{b<n}C_{J(b)}(k),
```
which is nonzero for every $`k`$; this also explains why the same indices work in every layer.

For the last assertion, suppose that a representation with $`d`$ summands exists and fix $`k`$. On the selected rows $`I(0),\ldots,I(d)`$ and columns $`J(0),\ldots,J(d)`$ the resulting matrix factors as
``` math
(f_\ell(I(a)))_{0\le a\le d,\,\ell<d}
 (G_\ell(J(b),k))_{\ell<d,\,0\le b\le d}.

It has rank at most $`d`$ and hence zero determinant, contradicting the nonzero minor of order $`d+1`$. ◻

Index selection is essential. The leading minors of the $`\{2,3,5\}`$ kernel are not a witness: row three is $`1/120`$ times row zero for $`j\le3`$ (checked), and the proportionality fails at $`j=4`$ (checked). A proof that read off leading minors alone would be false.

The same threshold description determines every finite sampled rank, rather than only producing one nonsingular minor.

If the distinct columns of a matrix are the $`v_h`$ with $`h`$ in a nonempty set $`E\subseteq\{0,\ldots,m\}`$, then its rank is

so they are linearly independent because their nonempty supports are disjoint. If $`h_1>0`$ or $`h_s<m`$, those supports miss a coordinate on which $`v_{h_1}`$ is nonzero, and adjoining $`v_{h_1}`$ gives rank $`s`$. If $`h_1=0`$ and $`h_s=m`$, the differences sum to $`(1-c)\mathbf 1`$ while $`v_0=c\mathbf 1`$, so $`v_0`$ is already in their span and the rank is $`s-1`$. ◻

To apply the proposition, sort any chosen row phases $`x_i`$. Each normalised column is a threshold column $`v_h`$, where $`h`$ is the number of sampled phases strictly below $`1-y_j`$.

## A sharp uniform obstruction for the normalised carry matrix

A fixed nonzero determinant remains nonzero under sufficiently small perturbations. What the preceding argument does not provide is one error threshold that works uniformly for the entire infinite matrix and all orders. The next theorem replaces exactness by a uniform distance, and the constant it produces is sharp. It concerns the normalised carry matrix
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:carry-matrix}
 C(i,j)=t^{\lfloor x_i+y_j\rfloor},
 \qquad
 x_i=\{i\log_r p\},\quad y_j=\{j\log_r q\},\quad t=r^{-1},
\end{equation}
```
which is the factor left in <a href="#long269:eq:carry-factorisation" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:carry-factorisation">[long269:eq:carry-factorisation]</a> after the row and column factors are divided out. Say that a real matrix $`A`$ on $`\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}`$ has *finite separated rank* when all of its columns lie in one finite-dimensional space of real sequences, equivalently when $`A(i,j)=\sum_{\ell<d}f_\ell(i)g_\ell(j)`$ for some finite $`d`$ and some sequences $`f_\ell,g_\ell`$, with no continuity or boundedness assumed.

**Theorem 12** (sharp uniform separated approximation). *Let $`p,q,r`$ be pairwise distinct primes and let $`C`$ be as in <a href="#long269:eq:carry-matrix" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:carry-matrix">[long269:eq:carry-matrix]</a>. Then
``` math
\inf_{A}\ \sup_{i,j\ge0}\ |C(i,j)-A(i,j)|=\frac{1-t}{2}=\frac{r-1}{2r},
```
the infimum being over all matrices $`A`$ of finite separated rank, and it is attained by the constant matrix of value $`(1+t)/2`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Every entry of $`C`$ lies in $`\{1,t\}`$, and $`C(i,j)=t`$ exactly when $`x_i+y_j\ge1`$. Fix $`j\ne k`$. The numbers $`y_j`$ are pairwise distinct, since $`\log_r q`$ is irrational, so we may assume $`y_j<y_k`$, and then $`0\le1-y_k<1-y_j\le1`$. Density of the orbit $`(x_i)`$ in $`(0,1)`$ supplies an index $`i`$ with $`1-y_k<x_i<1-y_j`$, and at that row the two columns carry the entries $`t`$ and $`1`$. Hence any two distinct columns of $`C`$ are at sup-distance exactly $`1-t`$.

Let $`A`$ have finite separated rank and put $`\varepsilon=\sup_{i,j}|C(i,j)-A(i,j)|`$. Suppose $`\varepsilon<(1-t)/2`$. Each column $`A_j`$ then satisfies $`\|A_j\|_\infty\le1+\varepsilon`$, so all columns of $`A`$ lie in $`W=V\cap\ell^{\infty}`$, where $`V`$ is the finite-dimensional space containing the columns of $`A`$; the space $`W`$ is a subspace of $`V`$, hence finite-dimensional, and $`\|\cdot\|_\infty`$ is a genuine norm on it. By the triangle inequality, distinct columns satisfy
``` math
\|A_j-A_k\|_\infty\ \ge\ \|C_j-C_k\|_\infty-2\varepsilon
 \ =\ 1-t-2\varepsilon\ >\ 0 .
```
The compactness input is the standard fact that closed bounded subsets of a finite-dimensional real normed space are compact. The use of $`W=V\cap\ell^\infty`$ is essential: the individual separated row factors need not be bounded. The columns $`A_j`$, $`j\ge0`$, are therefore infinitely many points of $`W`$, all of norm at most $`1+\varepsilon`$ and pairwise separated by a fixed positive distance. A bounded subset of a finite-dimensional normed space is totally bounded, so it contains no infinite uniformly separated family. This contradiction gives $`\varepsilon\ge(1-t)/2`$ for every $`A`$ of finite separated rank.

For sharpness take $`A(i,j)=(1+t)/2`$, which has separated rank one; every entry of $`C`$ is at distance exactly $`(1-t)/2`$ from it. ◻

</div>

The compactness step is standard, and the statement is recorded here for this kernel without a claim of technique. Three qualifications fix its reach. It is a statement about the normalised carry matrix <a href="#long269:eq:carry-matrix" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:carry-matrix">[long269:eq:carry-matrix]</a>: the original kernel carries positive row and column factors that decay, so the conclusion transfers to a weighted uniform norm relative to those factors and not to the unweighted sup norm of $`\operatorname{K}`$. It bounds approximation of the whole infinite matrix, and on any finite range a separated approximant of small rank exists. And it says nothing about approximating the scalar sum, so it yields no irrationality conclusion. What it does add to Theorem <a href="#long269:res:infinite-rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:infinite-rank">10</a> is robustness: no finite separated model of the carry, however chosen, gets uniformly closer than half a carry jump. The threshold is exact in both directions, since rank one attains it.

The original kernel behaves differently in the summation norm because its row and column factors decay. Let $`K^{(N)}(i,j,k)=\operatorname{K}(i,j,k)`$ for $`i<N`$ and $`K^{(N)}(i,j,k)=0`$ otherwise. This is a sum of at most $`N`$ terms separated between $`i`$ and $`(j,k)`$. Since $`\operatorname{H}(x)>x^3/(pqr)`$ for $`x>0`$, geometric summation gives
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:l1-finite-rank-approximation}
 \sum_{i,j,k\ge0}|\operatorname{K}(i,j,k)-K^{(N)}(i,j,k)|
 \le
 \frac{pqr\,p^{-3N}}
 {(1-p^{-3})(1-q^{-3})(1-r^{-3})}.
\end{equation}
```
Hence the original summable kernel has finite separated-rank approximants in $`\ell^1`$, even though its normalised carry matrix has the sharp uniform barrier of Theorem <a href="#long269:res:uniform-rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:uniform-rank">12</a>. This norm distinction is why neither statement decides the arithmetic nature of the scalar sum.

# Dyadic blocks and the literal infinite tail

For the rest of the note set $`P=\{2,3,5\}`$ and $`S=\mathcal R_P`$, and write $`\operatorname{H}_a=\operatorname{H}(2^{a})`$ and $`h_a=\operatorname{H}_a/2`$, so that $`h_0=1/2`$ while $`h_a`$ is a positive integer for $`a\ge1`$. Define the dyadic shell mass, its tail and its normalisation by

Compress the jump word of Section <a href="#long269:sec:lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:lcm">2</a> into the blocks cut out by consecutive powers of two: block $`a`$ starts just after $`2^{a}`$, contains every pure $`3`$- or $`5`$-power strictly between $`2^{a}`$ and $`2^{a+1}`$, and ends with the jump at $`2^{a+1}`$. A channel cannot occur twice inside one block, because two powers of the same base $`b\ge2`$ inside an interval of ratio $`2\le b`$ must coincide; this is the checked internal-power uniqueness lemma for the internal-power predicate. Let $`I_a`$ list the internal jumps $`(p,e)`$ with $`p\in\{3,5\}`$ and $`2^{a}<p^{e}<2^{a+1}`$, in increasing order.

Write the internal jumps as $`t_\ell=p_\ell^{e_\ell}`$, $`1\le\ell\le v`$, and set $`t_0=2^{a}`$, $`t_{v+1}=2^{a+1}`$.

This is an exact reindexing, not a polynomial formula for $`m_a`$. It isolates the moving triangular boundary as well as the two floor weights. The displayed proof and the finite checks accompanying this revision are not claimed as a new Lean declaration.

Since $`h_0=1/2`$, the last identity at $`a=0`$ writes $`S/2=X_0`$ as the Cantor series $`\sum_{j\ge0}m_j/(b_0\cdots b_j)`$, and $`X_a`$ is its normalised tail. Such tails, with their integer carry recurrence, are the classical tool for the rationality of Cantor series. Erdős and Straus characterise rationality by integer carries \[erdosstraus1974, Theorem 2.1 and (2.4), pp. 85–86\], and Hančl and Tijdeman give a practical form of that criterion through tails $`R_n`$ with $`a_nR_n=b_n+R_{n+1}`$, which is the recurrence above in their notation \[hancltijdeman2004, §§2–3 and Theorem 3.1, pp. 372–375\]. Koutsoukou-Argyraki and Li formalised the Erdős–Straus criteria in Isabelle/HOL \[afperdosstraus2020\]. Both criteria assume that the $`n`$th numerator is $`o(a_{n-1}a_n)`$, where $`a_n`$ is the $`n`$th base. Here $`m_a\ge1`$ and $`b_{a-1}b_a\le900`$, so neither criterion applies. The passage from rationality to integral tails is the standard denominator clearing, proved for this series in Section <a href="#long269:sec:actual-orbit" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:actual-orbit">6</a>; the work specific to this series is the literal forcing with its multiplicities, the strict endpoint normalisation and the explicit bounds. For polynomial Cantor data, Hančl–Tijdeman \[hancltijdeman2008, Theorems 2.2 and 3.1\] give a polynomial cancellation criterion and a division mechanism; their nonconstant polynomial radix is not our bounded $`(b_a)`$. Their separate Theorem 4.2 permits general integer radices, but assumes an exact finite-product decomposition with an integer transformed numerator $`o(b_a)`$. Here boundedness would force that transformed numerator to vanish eventually. Such a decomposition has not been proved for the literal $`m_a`$; the bound $`m_a=O(a^2)`$ does not produce one, nor does it force an integer carry to be a polynomial in the floor coordinates.

**Proposition 16** (integral state or cofinal separation). *For every integer $`B\ge1`$, either $`BX_a\in\mathbb{Z}`$ for some $`a\ge0`$ and every later $`a`$, or for every $`a_0`$ there is $`a\ge a_0`$ with $`|BX_a-z|\ge1/31`$ for every $`z\in\mathbb{Z}`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Set $`Y_a=BX_a`$, so $`Y_{a+1}=b_aY_a-Bm_a`$. If cofinal separation fails, there are $`A`$ and integers $`z_a`$ with $`e_a=Y_a-z_a`$ and $`|e_a|<1/31`$ for all $`a\ge A`$. The recurrence gives $`z_{a+1}-b_az_a+Bm_a=b_ae_a-e_{a+1}`$. The left side is an integer and the right side has absolute value below $`(30+1)/31=1`$, so both vanish and $`e_{a+1}=b_ae_a`$. Hence $`|e_{A+k}|\ge2^{k}|e_A|`$ for every $`k`$ while $`|e_{A+k}|<1/31`$, which forces $`e_A=0`$. Once $`Y_A`$ is integral, the integer recurrence makes every later $`Y_a`$ integral. ◻

</div>

The supplied formal source records the $`B=1`$ instance. Multiplying the forcing by the integer $`B`$ gives the ordinary proof of the scaled statement above, without requiring a new infinite-tail identity. Neither branch is excluded. For comparison, Erdős–Taylor \[erdostaylor1957, Theorem 1, p. 600\] prove a countability statement for increasing integer sequences with bounded successive ratios; Fan \[fan2026strongly, Lemma 3.1\] gives the unbounded-sequence version. For $`g_a=Bh_a`$ our integer-ratio argument is stronger: convergence of $`\operatorname{dist}(g_a\xi,\mathbb{Z})`$ to zero forces eventual integrality. Applying that statement to the particular $`\xi=S`$ still requires excluding the integral branch.

# A quadratic tail bound and denominator cancellation

Put
``` math
n_a=a+\lfloor\log_3(2^{a})\rfloor+\lfloor\log_5(2^{a})\rfloor,
 \qquad
 Q(n)=\frac{n^{2}+8n+18}{9},
```
so $`n_a`$ is the sum of the three height exponents at $`2^{a}`$.

**Theorem 17** (quadratic bound for the actual tail). *For every $`a\ge0`$, $`0<X_a\le Q(n_a)`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Partition the smooth integers $`x\ge2^{a}`$ by their height vector
``` math
(A,B,C)=(\lfloor\log_2x\rfloor,\lfloor\log_3x\rfloor,\lfloor\log_5x\rfloor).
```
The cell of a vector is the interval $`[\lambda,\eta)`$ with $`\lambda=\max(2^{A},3^{B},5^{C})`$ and $`\eta=\min(2^{A+1},3^{B+1},5^{C+1})`$, so $`\eta\le2^{A+1}\le2\lambda`$ and, by Lemma <a href="#long269:res:short" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:short">6</a>, fixing the exponents of $`3`$ and $`5`$ leaves at most one exponent of $`2`$. Since $`A\ge B\ge C`$, the cell contains at most
``` math
(B+1)(C+1)\le\frac{(A+B+C+3)^{2}}{9}
```
smooth points: writing $`u=B+1\ge v=C+1`$ and using $`A+1\ge u`$, the difference $`(2u+v)^{2}-9uv=(u-v)(4u-v)`$ is nonnegative. Unique factorisation identifies these exponent triples with distinct smooth integers.

As the cutoff increases all three height exponents are nondecreasing, so two nonempty cells with the same exponent sum are the same cell, and there is at most one nonempty cell of each rank. Every cell above $`2^{a}`$ has rank at least $`n_a`$, and a cell of rank $`n_a+k`$ has height at least $`\operatorname{H}_a2^{k}`$, since each of the $`k`$ extra prime factors is at least $`2`$. Nonnegative summation over ranks, allowing empty ones, gives
``` math
X_a\le\frac1{18}\sum_{k\ge0}\frac{(n_a+k+3)^{2}}{2^{k}}
      =\frac{n_a^{2}+8n_a+18}{9},
```
the evaluation using the geometric moments $`\sum2^{-k}=2`$, $`\sum k2^{-k}=2`$ and $`\sum k^{2}2^{-k}=6`$. Positivity follows from the shell at $`2^{a}`$. ◻

</div>

The rank here is the sum of the three fixed height exponents, not a varying-smoothness density parameter. The estimate uses only unique factorisation, the short-cell counting bound and geometric moments; it does not invoke a Dickman–Hildebrand asymptotic or a Hecke–Mahler theorem.

This is the analytic content of the section: each additional height rank costs a geometric factor while its multiplicity grows only quadratically. The finite projection and the sorted quadratic inequality are the checked ingredients of Proposition <a href="#long269:res:drop" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:drop">7</a>; grouping the actual infinite tail by height cells and summing the majorant is the argument above.

The bound is used at the endpoint of a window, where the natural index is the positive prime-power jump count strictly below the cutoff. Put
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:endpoint-index}
 j_a=\#\{p^{e}<2^{a}:p\in\{2,3,5\},\ e\ge1\}=n_a-1\qquad(a\ge1),
\end{equation}
```
the equality holding for $`a\ge1`$ because the powers of $`2`$ below $`2^{a}`$ number $`a-1`$ while the powers of $`3`$ and of $`5`$ below $`2^{a}`$ number $`\lfloor\log_3 2^{a}\rfloor`$ and $`\lfloor\log_5 2^{a}\rfloor`$; at $`a=0`$ the count is $`j_0=0`$ and $`n_0-1=-1`$. Substituting $`n_a=j_a+1`$ into $`Q`$ gives the integer bound used throughout the rest of the note:
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:actual-bound}
 K(B,a)=\bigl\lfloor B\,Q(n_a)\bigr\rfloor,
 \qquad
 K(B,a)=\left\lfloor\frac{B(j_a^{2}+10j_a+27)}9\right\rfloor\quad(a\ge1).

```
The cutoff in <a href="#long269:eq:endpoint-index" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:endpoint-index">[long269:eq:endpoint-index]</a> is $`2^{a}`$ and it is strict. The symbol $`K(B,a)`$ is an integer cap for an *integral* quantity $`BX_a`$: from $`BX_a\le BQ(n_a)`$ one may take the floor only after integrality has been established. We do not assert $`BX_a\le K(B,a)`$ for arbitrary real tails.

*Proof.* An empty window has mass zero. Otherwise $`b\ge1`$, and every integer $`x<2^{b}`$ has $`2`$-height exponent at most $`b-1`$ while its other height exponents are at most those at $`2^{b}`$, so $`\operatorname{H}(x)\mid\operatorname{H}_b/2=h_b`$ and every term of the finite window clears at $`h_b`$. Writing $`v_a=h_a\sum_{u<a}s_u\in\mathbb{N}`$ gives $`DX_a=h_aN-Dv_a\in\mathbb{Z}`$. Among $`D+1`$ of these integers two share a residue modulo $`D`$, and the corresponding states differ by an integer. ◻

The strict upper endpoint is what permits division by two. A cutoff including $`2^b`$ would not clear its term at the normaliser $`h_b=P_b/2`$.

The smooth part $`M`$ affects the clearing onset; the surviving carry bound depends on $`B`$. The displayed $`a_D`$ is a convenient sufficient onset. The next proposition gives the exact onset when $`N/D`$ is in lowest terms.

Since $`N`$ is coprime to $`MB`$ and $`h_a`$ is supported on $`\{2,3,5\}`$, reduction gives both denominators.

The smaller integer cap $`\widetilde K(B,a)=\lfloor B\widetilde Q(n_a)\rfloor`$ is therefore available to the rational direction. We retain $`K`$ in the main equivalence and old finite certificates to avoid silently changing the recorded tests. No optimality claim is made for either quadratic bound. The rational implication also works for any $`G\ge\widetilde K`$; together with $`G(B,a)=o(8^a)`$, the same proof gives an equivalence on this enlarged band. The named theorem below deliberately retains $`K`$ so that its formal-source interface and the archived certificates are unchanged.

Conversely suppose $`S\notin\mathbb{Q}`$, and fix $`B\ge1`$ coprime to $`30`$ and $`a_0\ge1`$. Set $`\ell=a_0`$ and $`\delta=\lceil BX_\ell\rceil-BX_\ell\in(0,1)`$; the prefix identity makes $`BX_\ell`$ irrational. For all sufficiently large $`h`$, $`0<\delta+BX_{\ell+h}/W_{\ell,h}<1`$, because $`X_{\ell+h}=O((\ell+h+1)^2)`$ and $`W_{\ell,h}>8^h/15`$. The integer $`\lceil BX_\ell\rceil W_{\ell,h}-BF_{\ell,h}`$ is therefore exactly
``` math
\operatorname{lpr}_{W_{\ell,h}}(-BF_{\ell,h})

Its first term eventually exceeds $`G(B,\ell+h)`$, since $`G(B,a)=o(8^a)`$. Thus every sufficiently long window from this fixed start escapes, which is stronger than the required existence.

For the two named bounds, $`K\le K_0`$ by Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-cancellation" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-cancellation">19</a>, both are quadratic in $`a`$ for fixed $`B`$, and $`K\le K`$ trivially.

For a rational value, a start before the clearing onset can therefore admit arbitrarily long escaping windows. This is why the rational contradiction must choose a start after the onset; one early start alone does not rule out rationality.

Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-escape-endpoint" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-escape-endpoint">24</a> makes the producer a restatement of Erdős #269 for $`P=\{2,3,5\}`$ throughout the band, so work on it is work on the target. The rational direction needs a bound valid for every actual positive carry. The bound $`K`$ is one such bound, and a smaller bound proved valid for the actual carries could replace it; the zero bound is invalid, and $`\mathsf E(0)`$ holds vacuously. Enlarging the bound to any $`G\ge K`$ with $`G(B,a)=o(8^{a})`$, in particular to any subexponential bound above $`K`$, preserves the equivalence. Equivalence preserves truth and settles nothing about difficulty, so the reformulation may still be the easier representation to attack.

Two exact countermodels rule out further shortcuts. For $`(W,F,B)=(6,4,1)`$ we have $`\operatorname{lpr}_6(-4)=2`$, so the canonical residue need not be coprime to the accumulated base. For $`(W,F,B)=(60,47,37)`$ we have $`\operatorname{lpr}_{60}(-37\cdot47)=1`$, so a fixed window has no denominator-independent lower bound on that residue. The window may therefore depend genuinely on $`B`$.

## How fast the window base grows

The crude estimate $`W_{\ell,h}\ge2^{h}`$ proves the smaller $`o(2^a)`$ band. The exact height formula proves the $`o(8^a)`$ band above and sets the scale of any finite search.

**Proposition 26** (window-growth law). *Put $`\theta_3=\log_32`$ and $`\theta_5=\log_52`$. For all $`\ell\ge0`$ and $`h\ge1`$,

On the other hand $`j_a\ge a-1`$, since the powers $`2,\ldots,2^{a-1}`$ already lie below $`2^{a}`$, so $`K(B,\ell+h)\ge\lfloor B((\ell-1)^{2}+10(\ell-1)+27)/9\rfloor`$, which tends to infinity with $`\ell`$. ◻

Corollary <a href="#long269:res:no-bounded-length" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:no-bounded-length">27</a> is the exact reason a finite scan cannot approach the cofinal quantifier by widening its denominator range alone. Rearranging its inequality, an escaping window at start $`\ell`$ and endpoint $`a=\ell+h`$ must satisfy
``` math
3h>\log_2K(B,a)-\log_215,
```
so the necessary search depth grows like $`\bigl(\log_2B+2\log_2\ell\bigr)/3`$. This is a lower bound on the length that can possibly work, and it is not an upper bound on the first length that does. An explicit eventual escape threshold can be obtained from a positive lower bound for $`\delta=\lceil BX_\ell\rceil-BX_\ell`$ and for $`1-\delta`$, together with the displayed tail and window estimates. Such information has not been supplied for the literal series. A necessary lower bound on window length is not a prediction of the distribution of first successful lengths and does not give an upper search bound.

# The finite evidence

The three displayed window tuples are directly replayable finite certificates. The larger scan and denominator exclusions below are archived computational reports. Their full execution records are not supplied here; in particular the two large exclusions lack their machine-readable witnesses. They are not theorem inputs, and none supplies the unbounded quantifiers.

<a id="the-dyadic-window-scan"></a>

## The dyadic-window scan

A *certificate* is a finite tuple of integers recording one instance of the inequality in <a href="#long269:eq:actual-escape" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:actual-escape">[long269:eq:actual-escape]</a>, so a reader can recheck the modular inequality immediately and reproduce the shell numerators by exact enumeration. The integer-only [dyadic-window checker](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/tree/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/scripts/check_erdos269_dyadic_windows.py) constructs the ordered pure-power jumps, the block bases and the block digits from exact multiplicity counts, and is the historical source of the following tuples. The package supplied with this revision independently reconstructs and verifies them, with columns the denominator $`B`$, the start $`\ell`$, the length $`h`$, the endpoint jump index $`j_{\ell+h}`$, the window base, the forcing, the residue $`R=\operatorname{lpr}_{W}(-BF)`$ and the bound $`K`$ of <a href="#long269:eq:actual-bound" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:actual-bound">[long269:eq:actual-bound]</a>.
``` math
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|r|r|r|r}
B&\ell&h&j_{\ell+h}&W&F&R&K\\ \hline
1&1&2&4&60&47&13&9\\
7&1&3&6&360&289&137&95\\
16&1&4&9&10800&8735&640&352
\end{array}
```
The first row reads as follows. The window starts at $`\ell=1`$ and has length $`2`$, so $`W=b_1b_2=6\cdot10=60`$; the accumulated forcing is $`F=47`$; and $`\operatorname{lpr}_{60}(-47)=13`$, since $`-47+60=13`$, which exceeds $`K(1,3)=\lfloor(16+40+27)/9\rfloor=9`$. The third row lies outside the domain of <a href="#long269:eq:actual-escape" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:actual-escape">[long269:eq:actual-escape]</a>, since $`\gcd(16,30)=2`$, and is displayed to illustrate the window arithmetic at greater depth.

The archived scan report covers $`B\le5000`$ coprime to $`30`$ and $`100\le\ell\le3000`$: $`3{,}869{,}934`$ pairs, with reported first escape length at most $`18`$ in a search to length $`24`$. This full scan was not rerun for this revision. Its histogram, retained in Section <a href="#long269:long:experiments" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:long:experiments">10.4</a>, is an archived observation, not a consequence of the window-growth bound. A fresh suite supplies all $`2496`$ witnesses for $`1\le B\le97`$, $`\gcd(B,30)=1`$ and $`1\le\ell\le96`$, with first escaping lengths from $`1`$ to $`10`$ in a search allowed up to $`24`$. A separate integer-only verifier reconstructs the shells and checks completeness of this rectangle. Neither suite proves escape for unbounded $`B`$ or for cofinally many starts; Corollary <a href="#long269:res:no-bounded-length" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:no-bounded-length">27</a> rules out covering the latter quantifier with any fixed maximum length.

## Two finite denominator exclusions

<a id="long269:res:lead-block-exclusion"></a>

#### Archived window-$`128`$ exclusion report (witness unavailable).

The archived report asserts the following, which is not used as a proved result in this revision. At window length $`L=128`$, launch $`a_1=10005`$ and $`64`$ starts, no rational value of the $`\{2,3,5\}`$ running-LCM series has reduced denominator $`MB`$ with $`M`$ a $`30`$-smooth divisor of $`2^{10005}3^{6312}5^{4308}`$, $`\gcd(B,30)=1`$ and $`1<B\le B_{\max}`$, where $`B_{\max}`$ is the $`106`$-digit integer
``` math
\begin{aligned}
 B_{\max}={}&1134599670999687767349520845707093359257353022286558739363600235\\
 &016103207564063373270305324172145281971729 ,
\end{aligned}
```
so that $`\log_2B_{\max}=348.9846\ldots`$

The exponent triple $`(10005,6312,4308)`$ is the height exponent triple of $`\operatorname{H}(2^{10005})`$, so the certificate normalises by the full height at its launch. Lemma <a href="#long269:res:all-scale-lattice" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:all-scale-lattice">18</a> normalises by the half height $`h_{10005}`$; the certificate’s smooth family is accordingly the larger one. The recorded quantities are the window product with $`\log_2P=386.40993\ldots`$, the exclusion index $`J=1`$ certified from a reduced basis lying inside the per-start budget, an enclosure of width $`9.674\times10^{-227}`$, and a maximum ratio $`\max X/W=0.185997`$. The machine-readable certificate and a replay receipt are absent. Consequently this is a provenance record, not a verified denominator exclusion available to the reader. Before restoring a theorem environment, publish the exact enclosure, reduction basis, integer inequalities, engine revision and reproducible command. No Lean declaration is claimed for it.

<a id="long269:res:cf-exclusion"></a>

#### Archived continued-fraction exclusion report (witness unavailable).

The archived report asserts that the normalised tail $`X_1`$ has $`13{,}109`$ certified partial quotients, so it is not rational with denominator at most $`2^{22482}`$, about $`10^{6768}`$.

The stated certification method is a common prefix of the continued fractions of the two endpoints of an interval provably containing $`X_1`$; the numbers with a given prefix of partial quotients form an interval \[bosmaCF, Lemma 10.1.2, p. 106\], so no approximation heuristic enters, and the truncation was independently checked to agree with the direct smooth-number sum as an exact rational. The machine-readable witness and replay receipt are absent; the asserted exclusion is therefore not a theorem input. A replay must supply rational endpoints, a proof that the entire interval contains $`X_1`$, the common continued-fraction cylinder, and a rigorous lower bound for denominators of all rationals in the enclosure. A count of matching partial quotients alone is not that denominator certificate. The recorded statistics are a largest denominator of $`22{,}483`$ bits, a largest partial quotient of $`129{,}114`$, a mean partial quotient of $`23.4133`$, observed Gauss–Kuzmin frequencies $`0.4208`$, $`0.1665`$, $`0.0917`$, $`0.0575`$, $`0.0391`$ against the predicted $`0.4150`$, $`0.1699`$, $`0.0931`$, $`0.0589`$, $`0.0406`$, and a Lévy constant of $`1.18869`$ against $`\pi^{2}/(12\log2)=1.18657`$. The predicted values are the almost-everywhere frequencies of Gauss’s law and Lévy’s almost-everywhere constant \[levy1936, pp. 288–289 and footnote 5\]. These statistics describe a finite prefix and do not bear on whether $`X_1`$ is a Liouville number, algebraic, or rational with a larger denominator.

The two archived reports concern different finite families: one uses a lattice at a fixed launch and fixed smooth part, the other a continued-fraction enclosure at $`a=1`$. Neither has a replayable witness in this packet. Even after verification, each would exclude only its stated denominator range and neither would settle an instance of the problem.

# The remaining arithmetic questions

<a id="long269:sec:weighted-shifts"></a>

## An exact weighted-shift identity for the repeated series

This subsection concerns $`S`$, not $`\mathcal D_{2,3,5}`$. Write $`P_a=\operatorname{H}(2^a)`$, $`\alpha=S/2`$ and $`\alpha_t=\sum_{k<t}m_k/P_{k+1}`$. The literal coefficient object is Lemma <a href="#long269:res:literal-triangle" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:literal-triangle">15</a>; its size bound is not a polynomial representation.

<div id="long269:res:weighted-shift-identity" class="lemma">

**Lemma 28** (weighted shifts preserve the actual value). *Fix integers $`c_0,\ldots,c_\sigma`$, not all zero, independently of the positive integer shift $`r`$. Put
``` math
\gamma_{a,t}=\frac{P_tP_{a+1}}{P_{a+t+1}},\qquad
 D_{r,a}=15\sum_{j=0}^{\sigma}c_j\gamma_{a,jr}m_{a+jr}.
```
Then $`\gamma_{a,t}\in\{1,1/3,1/5,1/15\}`$ and $`D_{r,a}\in\mathbb{Z}`$. Furthermore, with
``` math
A_r=15\sum_{j=0}^{\sigma}c_jP_{jr},\qquad
 Z_r=15\sum_{j=0}^{\sigma}c_jP_{jr}\alpha_{jr}\in\mathbb{Z},
```
we have the absolutely convergent identity
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:weighted-shift-identity}
 A_r\alpha-Z_r=\sum_{a\ge0}\frac{D_{r,a}}{P_{a+1}}.
\end{equation}
```
One may take $`C=225\sum_{j=0}^{\sigma}|c_j|\max(1,j)^2`$ in $`|D_{r,a}|\le C(a+r+1)^2`$. If $`J`$ is the largest index with $`c_J\ne0`$, then $`A_r\ne0`$ whenever $`\sum_{j<J}|c_j|2^{-(J-j)r}<|c_J|`$; an empty sum is zero.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* The two-exponents cancel in $`\gamma`$. For $`p=3,5`$, floor addition leaves exponent zero or $`-1`$, proving the four-valued assertion and integrality. For $`k<jr`$, $`P_{k+1}`$ divides $`P_{jr}`$, so $`Z_r`$ is an integer. For each $`t`$, absolute convergence gives
``` math
\sum_{a\ge0}\frac{\gamma_{a,t}m_{a+t}}{P_{a+1}}
 =P_t\sum_{k\ge t}\frac{m_k}{P_{k+1}}
 =P_t(\alpha-\alpha_t).
```
The finite linear combination proves the identity. Lemma <a href="#long269:res:literal-triangle" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:literal-triangle">15</a>, $`0<\gamma\le1`$ and $`a+jr+1\le\max(1,j)(a+r+1)`$ give the stated constant. For $`j<J`$, $`P_{jr}/P_{Jr}\le2^{-(J-j)r}`$. Dividing $`A_r`$ by $`15P_{Jr}`$ and bounding the remaining terms proves the nonvanishing condition, which holds for all sufficiently large $`r`$. ◻

The identity was derived in the earlier editorial structural note and is included here with its complete proof. It is not claimed as an application of an existing fixed-base theorem or as a Lean-checked statement.

<a id="long269:sec:boundary-difference"></a>

## The boundary term in the weighted difference

Let $`T_a=\{(j,k)\in\mathbb N^2:w_{j,k}<a+1\}`$ and, for $`0\le t<1`$, set
``` math
\omega_a(t)=\prod_{p\in\{3,5\}}
 p^{\lfloor(a+1)\theta_p\rfloor-\lfloor(a+t)\theta_p\rfloor}.
```
This weight is defined even for pairs outside $`T_a`$. For $`\nu\ge0`$, put
``` math
\begin{split}
 \kappa_p(a,t,\nu r)
 &=\lfloor(a+t+\nu r)\theta_p\rfloor
   -\lfloor(a+t)\theta_p\rfloor-\lfloor\nu r\theta_p\rfloor,\\
 \chi_\nu(a,t)&=3^{-\kappa_3(a,t,\nu r)}5^{-\kappa_5(a,t,\nu r)}.
 \end{split}
```
Each $`\kappa_p`$ is $`0`$ or $`1`$. We call it a crossing only in this precise floor-addition sense; the moving edge of $`T_a`$ is a different boundary.

<div id="long269:res:strip-decomposition" class="proposition">

**Proposition 29** (an exact interior-and-strip decomposition). *For a fixed operator $`c_0,\ldots,c_\sigma`$ and $`r\ge1`$, let $`E_0=T_a`$ and $`E_s=T_{a+sr}\setminus T_{a+(s-1)r}`$ for $`1\le s\le\sigma`$. Then
``` math
\frac{D_{r,a}}{15}=
 \sum_{s=0}^{\sigma}\ \sum_{(j,k)\in E_s}
 \omega_a(t_{j,k})\sum_{\nu=s}^{\sigma}c_\nu\chi_\nu(a,t_{j,k}).
```
For the cubic operator $`(1,-3,3,-1)`$, if all these crossing bits vanish, then
``` math
\frac{D_{r,a}}{15}=-M_0+2M_1-M_2,\qquad
 M_s=\sum_{(j,k)\in T_{a+(s+1)r}\setminus T_{a+sr}}\omega_a(t_{j,k}).
```
Thus absence of floor crossings cancels the common interior, but not necessarily the three boundary strips.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Cancellation of the two upper-boundary exponents gives the pointwise identity
``` math
\gamma_{a,\nu r}\omega_{a+\nu r}(t)
   =\omega_a(t)\chi_\nu(a,t).

Insert the triangle formula for each $`m_{a+\nu r}`$ and group by the first triangle containing a pair. A pair in $`E_s`$ occurs exactly in the terms $`\nu\ge s`$, proving the first formula. Under the no-crossing hypothesis, $`\chi_\nu=1`$. The full cubic sum is zero, while its three successive suffix sums are $`-1,2,-1`$, proving the second formula. ◻

<div id="long269:res:no-crossing-counterexample" class="example">

**Example 30** (cubic cancellation can fail with no floor crossings). Take $`a=0`$, $`r=35`$ and $`(c_0,c_1,c_2,c_3)=(1,-3,3,-1)`$. Exact integer comparisons give
``` math
\begin{array}{c|rrrr}
 u&0&35&70&105\\\hline
 \lfloor\log_3 2^u\rfloor=\lfloor\log_3 2^{u+1}\rfloor&0&22&44&66\\

 m_u&1&195&723&1582
\end{array}
```
The first two rows imply $`b_u=2`$ and $`\lfloor(u+t)\theta_p\rfloor=\lfloor u\theta_p\rfloor`$ for every $`0\le t<1`$, $`p=3,5`$. Hence every relevant $`\kappa_p(0,t,u)`$ vanishes, $`\gamma_{0,u}=1`$, and all triangle weights at these four indices are $`1`$. The last row is therefore the count of pairs satisfying $`3^j5^k<2^{u+1}`$, not a floating-point estimate. The strips have sizes $`194,528,859`$, so
``` math
D_{35,0}=15(-194+2\cdot528-859)=45\ne0.
```
A portable certificate records the count in every $`j`$-row and verifies all power inequalities using integers. This single example disproves unconditional cubic cancellation from carry avoidance. It does not exclude a different fixed operator, different shifts, a boundary correction or a sparse-defect statement restricted to a suitable infinite subsequence.

<a id="what-the-heckemahler-comparison-does-and-does-not-supply."></a>

#### What the Hecke–Mahler comparison does and does not supply.

In the published Luca–Ouaknine–Worrell article \[lucaouaknineworrell2025\], Definition 5 requires both expanding gaps and polynomial variation of nonzero finite-difference defects. Theorem 6 is the associated fixed-base value criterion; Theorem 8 and Claim 10 establish the hypotheses for polynomial floor sequences. Claim 10 uses exact finite-difference cancellation when no floor crossing occurs. Our $`m_a`$ is instead a weighted lattice count. Proposition <a href="#long269:res:strip-decomposition" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:strip-decomposition">29</a> separates floor crossings from its moving boundary, and Example <a href="#long269:res:no-crossing-counterexample" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:no-crossing-counterexample">30</a> shows that the latter can survive a cubic difference even with no crossings. The correction preserves the value, but does not prove sparseness.

A possible coefficient target is a fixed operator and shifts $`r_n\to\infty`$ for which $`\Delta_n=\{a\ge0:D_{r_n,a}\ne0\}`$ is infinite and distinct members are at least $`\eta r_n`$ apart, for a fixed $`\eta>0`$. Even this would leave the uniform polynomial-variation requirement, for example
``` math
|D_{r_n,a'}|\le C\bigl((a'-a)^d+|D_{r_n,a}|\bigr)
 \quad(a<a',\ a,a'\in\Delta_n),
```
with $`C,d`$ independent of $`n`$. The bound $`O((a+r+1)^2)`$ is not this relative-variation estimate. There is also a representation issue: the displayed denominator chain is not a fixed-base power sequence. The next proposition shows exactly what is lost in two direct fixed-base recodings. A theorem for the original chain would need a separate proof, including non-cancellation and the height estimates in any Subspace-Theorem argument. The finite set of prime divisors alone does not provide those estimates.

<a id="the-echoing-comparison-has-a-different-interface."></a>

#### The echoing comparison has a different interface.

Kebis, Luca, Ouaknine, Scoones and Worrell \[kebis2024echoing, Definition 3, Theorem 6 and Claim 7\] work with fixed-base series whose coefficients lie in a finite algebraic alphabet, and require non-vanishing weighted mismatch sums. The four-letter radix sequence is not the numerator sequence: the actual $`m_a`$ is unbounded. A recoding would have to preserve the scalar value, identify its coefficient alphabet and verify those mismatch conditions. No such recoding is proved here.

<div id="long269:res:fixed-base-recoding" class="proposition">

**Proposition 31** (what direct fixed-base recoding preserves). *The following identities converge absolutely:
``` math
\alpha=\sum_{a\ge0}\frac{e_a}{30^{a+1}}
        =\sum_{a\ge0}\frac{v_a}{8^{a+1}},\qquad
 e_a=\frac{m_a30^{a+1}}{P_{a+1}},\quad
 v_a=\frac{m_a8^{a+1}}{P_{a+1}}.
```
Here $`e_a\in\mathbb Z_{>0}`$ and $`e_a\ge(15/4)^{a+1}`$, whereas $`v_a\in\mathbb Z[1/15]`$ and $`0<v_a<225(a+1)^2`$. For an integer $`q\ge2`$, the termwise divisibility $`P_n\mid q^n`$ for every $`n\ge1`$ holds exactly when $`30\mid q`$; that direct recoding then has coefficients at least $`(q/8)^{a+1}`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Each exponent in $`P_n`$ is at most $`n`$, so $`P_n\mid30^n`$. Also $`8^n/15<P_n\le8^n`$ by the exact two-exponent and the strict three- and five-power bounds. These facts, $`m_a\ge1`$ and $`m_a\le15(a+1)^2`$, give all the coefficient bounds and identities. Necessity of $`30\mid q`$ follows because each of $`2,3,5`$ divides some $`P_n`$; sufficiency follows from $`P_n\mid30^n`$. The general lower bound follows again from $`P_n\le8^n`$. ◻

</div>

The base-$`30`$ coefficients are integral but not polynomially bounded, so they do not satisfy the hypotheses of the cited fixed-base polynomial-growth criterion. The base-$`8`$ coefficients have polynomial size, but integrality and the required arithmetic height bounds are not established. No claim is made that their reduced denominators are unbounded: cancellation with $`m_a`$ must be considered. These are obstructions to the direct recodings, not a proof that all possible fixed-base representations fail. Adamczewski–Bugeaud’s complexity theorem \[adamczewskibugeaud2007, Theorem 1\] concerns the actual digits of an integer-base expansion: for an algebraic irrational their length-$`n`$ block complexity divided by $`n`$ tends to infinity. Neither $`(b_a)`$ nor the uncarried $`(e_a)`$ is such a digit expansion of $`\alpha`$.

The first formulation uses finite integer data but unbounded denominator and onset quantifiers; the second uses the actual real tail. Neither is an additional hypothesis imposed on the series, and neither is proved by the rank obstruction. The next proposition records their common scalar target, complementing Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-escape-endpoint" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-escape-endpoint">24</a>.

**Proposition 33** (the reduced-tail question is also the target). *Statement <a href="#long269:eq:tail-nonintegrality" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:tail-nonintegrality">[long269:eq:tail-nonintegrality]</a>, quantified over every $`B\ge1`$ coprime to $`30`$ and every $`a\ge1`$, is equivalent to irrationality of $`S`$.*

Conversely if $`S\in\mathbb{Q}`$, then Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-cancellation" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-cancellation">19</a> produces $`B`$ coprime to $`30`$ with $`BX_a\in\mathbb{Z}`$ for every $`a\ge a_D`$. ◻

Integrality at one index propagates forwards, but nonintegrality at one early index does not propagate forever: a rational denominator can clear later. Proposition <a href="#long269:res:exact-denominator" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:exact-denominator">20</a> describes that onset exactly. The scaled dichotomy also permits an integral branch, so it does not settle the target.

## The analytic route and what it would need

For the de-duplicated series put
``` math
\mathcal D_{2,3,5}=1+
 \sum_{t\in\{2^{n},3^{n},5^{n}:n\ge1\}}
 \frac{1}{2^{\lfloor\log_2t\rfloor}3^{\lfloor\log_3t\rfloor}
           5^{\lfloor\log_5t\rfloor}} ,
```
whose dyadic coding is the joint rotation word $`\delta_{3,a}=\lfloor(a+1)\theta_3\rfloor-\lfloor a\theta_3\rfloor`$ and $`\delta_{5,a}=\lfloor(a+1)\theta_5\rfloor-\lfloor a\theta_5\rfloor`$, with $`b_a=2\cdot3^{\delta_{3,a}}5^{\delta_{5,a}}`$.

<div id="long269:prob:representation" class="problem">

**Problem 34** (function-faithful two-dimensional representation). The historical irrationality assertion for $`\mathcal D_{2,3,5}`$ is not being reclassified as a new open problem. A recovered proof or a transcendence theorem would require its own argument. For a functional approach, first specify the function, its coefficient field and convergence domain, then prove an exact identity for $`\mathcal D_{2,3,5}`$, and only then apply a stated value theorem. A conditional theorem must display the extra nondegeneracy assumption; a no-representation theorem must specify the class it excludes.

Individual irrationality of $`\theta_3`$ and $`\theta_5`$ is what Theorem <a href="#long269:res:infinite-rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:infinite-rank">10</a> uses, and it is weaker than the joint equidistribution or the rational independence of $`1,\theta_3,\theta_5`$ that a two-dimensional value theorem may need; the stronger hypothesis is not assumed anywhere above. The finite-observer formalisation isolates the precise faithfulness requirement: equality in a finite observer must imply equality after symbolic realisation, and a genuine finite-dimensional factorisation forces the realised symbolic span to be finite-dimensional ([residue-coboundary form](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/WeightedPhaseCarry.lean#L109), [symbolic realisation](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/WeightedPhaseCarry.lean#L293), [checked](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/WeightedPhaseCarry.lean#L334)), with the carry residue and residue digit confined to their declared intervals ([carry interval](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/WeightedPhaseCarry.lean#L150), [digit interval](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/WeightedPhaseCarry.lean#L157)). No theorem here proves that the literal realised span is infinite.

#### Which value-theorem hypotheses remain missing.

Pellarin’s rank-one theorem \[pellarin2006, Theorem 1.1\] treats Hecke–Mahler values with a quadratic irrational slope and a specified rank-one module condition on the algebraic evaluation points. Two lattice coordinates alone imply neither hypothesis. For linear Mahler systems in one variable, Adamczewski and Faverjon give a new proof of Nishioka’s theorem \[adamczewskifaverjon2023, Theorems 1 and 2\]; one must have a Mahler functional system and a regular algebraic evaluation point. Their multivariate theory is now published \[adamczewskifaverjon2026\]. The author manuscript’s Theorem 3.3 and Sections 3 and 5 retain a genuine functional system, regularity of the evaluation point and admissibility of the transformation–point pair. No such system or evaluation data for the literal three-prime sum are constructed in this record. In particular, the theorem’s freedom in the system matrix does not remove its transformation and point hypotheses. The source audit distinguishes the 68-page author manuscript used for these locators, the older 52-page arXiv version and the journal metadata.

## Structural constraints already in place

The radix alphabet extends without difficulty. For ordered primes $`p_1<\cdots<p_s`$ an interval $`(p_1^{a},p_1^{a+1})`$ contains at most one power from each other channel, because consecutive $`p_i`$-powers have ratio $`p_i>p_1`$, so its block radix belongs to the $`2^{s-1}`$-letter alphabet $`\{p_1\prod_{i=2}^{s}p_i^{\varepsilon_i}:\varepsilon_i\in\{0,1\}\}`$. The quantitative questions are the interesting ones: effective recurrence or discrepancy for the actual four-letter $`\{2,6,10,30\}`$ word, an asymptotic with an error term for the restricted two-dimensional shell counts that generate $`m_a`$, or the exact separated rank of the literal kernel under a specified family of shifts.

Three-channel rigidity and carry-lift extinction already exclude one proposed argument in four exact steps. Under channel surjectivity, ordinary block nullity is equivalent to the perturbation being a coboundary of a channel potential (potential classifier). Zero perturbations on genuine $`2\to3`$ and $`2\to5`$ transitions then identify all three potential values and force the perturbation to vanish at every index. For an integral lift, that vanishing makes a nonzero initial error grow by the exact product of the successive bases, and bases at least two make its absolute value at least $`2^{N}`$, contradicting even a single index-$`N`$ bound strictly below $`2^{N}`$ (one-index extinction); consequently no uniform bound on the lift error can hold either (uniform extinction). A separate four-state calculation reaches the obstruction earlier: four real states in $`(0,1)`$ with unit-accuracy integral lifts and the two anchor equalities force the first complete $`2`$-block sum to be $`1`$, so that block cannot be null (first-block sum, four-state obstruction).

These lift conclusions are conditional. The paper constructs the actual orbit and its bounded integral carry under rationality, and it does not construct a faithful lift with the two anchors or the block nullity those auxiliary statements require. The actual carry supplies a weighted block defect instead, so any successful argument along that line must use the weighted identity or construct a different faithful lift.

A single conditional single-channel criterion is also on record. For the pure $`2`$-channel sum the Cantor states lie in an explicit open interval (confinement), consecutive states are separated (gap bound), a small nonzero linear form forces irrationality (criterion), and clearing together with small gaps assembles to irrationality (assembly). The clearing and small-gap hypotheses are not discharged for any concrete series, so no irrationality statement follows from them here.

<a id="where-the-problem-stands"></a>

## Where the problem stands

The two-prime transcendence deduction is an earlier application of the cited value theorem. For the repeated $`\{2,3,5\}`$ value, this record establishes the literal coefficients, integral recurrence, exact clearing, quadratic bounds and the equivalent residue target. It does not establish irrationality. The rank and uniform-norm obstructions concern the kernel, not the arithmetic of its sum. The fixed-start residue formula clarifies the target’s quantifiers, while the strip decomposition identifies a concrete obstruction to transplanting cubic no-crossing cancellation. A further argument must use the actual weighted multiplicities to exclude eventual integral reduced tails. Finite tests, countability, low-complexity radix coding and denominator support do not by themselves do so.

<a id="statements-and-declarations"></a>

## Statements and declarations

<a id="proof-sources."></a>

#### Proof sources.

The two-prime deduction rests on the cited external value theorem and is not formalised here; Fan’s recorded priority is retained. The attached `LEAN_INDEX.json` at public commit `3d6d938d696fed0fb71dd55115a18a73738ff223` records a successful CI build for the relevant public source closure. This includes arbitrary-order kernel rank, the actual tail recurrence, rationality clearing, the actual $`Q`$ and $`\widetilde Q`$ bounds, and the $`o(8^a)`$ equivalence band. The separate Palomar release at `52f29ad1` selects the arbitrary-order uniform-minor and prime non-separation clauses, as well as the finite fixture. Its Comparator evidence is therefore not limited to a $`2\times2`$ determinant. These statements report the supplied receipts; this editorial revision did not rerun Lean, Isabelle, Comparator or NanoDa. The source index is not a blanket axiom audit. Individual historical links keep their own pins and must not be treated as byte-identical to the newer tree without a comparison. The weighted-triangle and weighted-shift identities, exact denominator formula, scaled dichotomy, strengthened rigidity, residue limit, strip decomposition and direct recoding proposition have ordinary proofs. The new finite checks support their finite instances, not their infinite quantifiers. None is presented as a new formalisation result of this pass. The large numerical exclusions remain archived reports until their witnesses are published. No evidence item supplies the source-specific cofinal escape.

<a id="artefact-and-data-availability."></a>

#### Artefact and data availability.

The [pinned formal-source revision](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/tree/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8) contains the Lean sources, the fixed toolchain, the library manifest, and the exact dyadic-window checker used in the finite scan. Those sources support only the formal statements identified in the evidence register. Ordinary proofs and external analytic inputs have their own stated dependencies; the unavailable numerical witnesses are not supplied by a repository link.

Priority for the two-prime factorisation, its Hecke–Mahler reduction and the running-LCM identity for every $`|P|`$ belongs to Steve Fan’s forum post of 26 June 2026 \[fan2026comment\]. The transcendence input is due to Yann Bugeaud and Michel Laurent and to the earlier work of Loxton and van der Poorten cited by them. The problem numbering and historical status snapshot are taken from the Erdős Problems catalogue maintained by Thomas Bloom \[erdosproblems\].

# Extended record: migrated arguments and finite evidence

This part of the record holds material that the short note compressed or moved. It separates auxiliary arguments, historical reports and exact source coordinates. The mathematical references are this record’s labels; archived computations are not promoted to theorem inputs by appearing in an appendix.

<a id="long269:long:history"></a>

## The historical and catalogue record

In the primary 1988 source Erdős states the infinite-$`P`$ assertion as a simple exercise and presents persistence for a finite number of primes greater than one as a probable extension, and not as a theorem \[erdos1988, p. 106\]. The catalogue snapshot cited in the supplied manuscript records an open problem \[erdosproblems\]; that historical status is not inferred from the conjectural wording and has not been reverified against the live page for this revision. The 1974 letter writes “given primes $`p_1,\ldots,p_r`$” without explicitly restricting $`r`$, so the singleton case, whose value is $`p/(p-1)`$, must be excluded by hand; the modern restriction $`|P|\ge2`$ does that.

The letter’s de-duplicated assertion is made for a general finite list of primes and supplies no proof, so it is an asserted historical result and not an open problem. The note therefore restricts its open statement to the repeated series $`\mathcal R_P`$. A recovered proof of the letter’s assertion, or a transcendence statement for $`\mathcal D_P`$ with $`|P|\ge3`$, would be a different question and needs its own formulation.

The letter prints no argument. On 26 June 2026 Steve Fan posted the two-prime factorisation, the Hecke–Mahler reduction and the transcendence conclusion in the discussion thread of the problem’s page \[fan2026comment\]; the comment itself notes that the argument does not seem to generalise immediately to $`|P|\ge3`$, and a reply there observes that it applies to arbitrary coprime pairs. The supplied publication record dates the note’s first public manuscript to 22 July 2026, at commit `a9d3ab8`, after Fan’s post. We retain the calculation as exposition and make no priority claim for it.

The statement of the problem has been formalised as a conjecture with an unfilled proof in the *Formal Conjectures* collection \[formalconjectures269\]. Its Nat-indexed series includes the empty-prefix least-common-multiple term, so its value differs from the conventional one by a rational constant; transporting a theorem across that boundary needs an explicit series-identification lemma, which is not supplied here.

<a id="long269:long:general-carries"></a>

## The abstract carry lemmas in their general form

The note applies the carry machinery to the literal $`\{2,3,5\}`$ orbit. The underlying statements are about integer sequences alone, they are reusable, and they are recorded here in the generality in which they are checked. They are conditional carry lemmas in the Cantor-series tradition described after Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-orbit" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-orbit">14</a>, and each assumes its divisibility or escape hypothesis.

Let $`D=D_{\mathrm{sm}}B`$ with $`D_{\mathrm{sm}}=2^{u}3^{v}5^{w}`$ and $`\gcd(B,30)=1`$, and let $`(c_n)`$ be an integer sequence satisfying $`c_{n+1}=b_nc_n-Dm_n`$ for an integer radix word $`(b_n)`$ and forcing word $`(m_n)`$.

<div id="long269:long:denominator-reduction" class="proposition">

**Proposition 35** (conditional denominator reduction). *If $`c_n=D_{\mathrm{sm}}d_n`$ for every $`n`$, with $`D_{\mathrm{sm}}>0`$, then the recurrence, positivity, upper bound and window identity for $`(c_n)`$ reduce to the same four statements for $`(d_n)`$ with multiplier $`B`$ in place of $`D`$.*

</div>

Height absorption alone does not imply divisibility of a carry state. The identity $`DX_a=h_aN-Dv_a`$ of Lemma <a href="#long269:res:all-scale-lattice" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:all-scale-lattice">18</a> is what supplies it for the actual orbit, and Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-cancellation" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-cancellation">19</a> is the instance in which the note uses it. The formal consumer takes the common-factor form as a hypothesis.

<div id="long269:long:windowconsumer" class="proposition">

**Proposition 36** (conditional extinction of bounded carries). *Let $`(b_n)`$ and $`(m_n)`$ be a radix word and a forcing word, let $`G:\mathbb{N}_{>0}\times\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}`$, and assume cofinal local-window escape against $`G`$. Fix $`B>0`$ coprime to $`30`$. There is no integral sequence $`(d_n)`$ satisfying simultaneously $`d_{n+1}=b_nd_n-Bm_n`$, $`d_n>0`$ and $`|d_n|\le G(B,n)`$ for every $`n\ge0`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Choose one escaping window $`(\ell,h)`$. The window identity gives $`d_{\ell+h}\equiv-BF_{\ell,h}`$ modulo $`|W_{\ell,h}|`$. The endpoint state is positive and at most $`G(B,\ell+h)`$, whereas the canonical positive residue of the right-hand side exceeds that bound, so Proposition <a href="#long269:res:consumer" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:consumer">23</a> applies. ◻

</div>

Coprimality with $`30`$ is used by the escape hypothesis to select a window; once a window is fixed, the finite contradiction does not use it. The formalisation carries the edge cases: a zero window base is excluded, a zero residue is represented by the full modulus, and positivity prevents the endpoint carry from vanishing. The packaged absorbed form takes a nonzero smooth factor, the exact factorisation $`c_n=D_{\mathrm{sm}}d_n`$, the absorbed recurrence for $`(c_n)`$ and the positive short bound for $`(d_n)`$, and derives the same contradiction in one statement.

## Worked finite examples

The ten smallest values of the running least common multiple at $`\{2,3,5\}`$ are tabulated in Section <a href="#long269:sec:lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:lcm">2</a>. They illustrate both parts of Proposition <a href="#long269:res:cell" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:cell">3</a>: the value is constant on $`\{5,6,7\}`$ and on $`\{9,10\}`$, and each change multiplies by a single prime, by $`2`$ at $`x=2,4,8`$, by $`3`$ at $`x=3,9`$ and by $`5`$ at $`x=5`$. Also $`\operatorname{L}(10)=8\cdot9\cdot5=360`$ is the least common multiple of the smooth numbers $`1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10`$.

For Proposition <a href="#long269:res:fibre" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:fibre">5</a> take $`(p,q,r)=(2,3,5)`$ and the box $`\mathcal B(1,1,1)`$, whose eight points carry the smooth values $`1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30`$ and the heights
``` math
\begin{array}{c|cccccccc}
p^{i}q^{j}r^{k}&1&2&3&5&6&10&15&30\\ \hline
\operatorname{H}&1&2&6&60&60&360&360&10800
\end{array}
```
Six heights occur, two of them twice: the points $`5`$ and $`6`$ share the height $`60`$, and $`10`$ and $`15`$ share the height $`360`$. The identity reads
``` math
1+\tfrac12+\tfrac16+\tfrac1{60}+\tfrac1{60}+\tfrac1{360}+\tfrac1{360}
 +\tfrac1{10800}
 =1+\tfrac12+\tfrac16+\tfrac2{60}+\tfrac2{360}+\tfrac1{10800}
 =\tfrac{18421}{10800},
```
and the two coefficients $`2`$ carry the whole content of the regrouping on this box. Where the heights are pairwise distinct the identity is a relabelling.

Multiplying block radices along a run of blocks gives the product of the jump-word letters over that run: for instance $`b_1b_2=60`$ is the product of the four multipliers at $`3,4,5,8`$. Block $`4`$ is the only one among the first six carrying an internal power in both channels, and block $`5`$ carries neither, so its radix falls back to the terminal factor alone.

<a id="long269:long:experiments"></a>

## The finite-scan histogram

The archived scan report described in Section <a href="#long269:sec:evidence" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:evidence">8</a> claims coverage of $`B\le5000`$ coprime to $`30`$ and $`100\le\ell\le3000`$, with search depth $`24`$. It reports $`3{,}869{,}934`$ pairs, an escape in every case, and the following first-success histogram. These figures were not rerun for this revision and are retained as historical data:
``` math
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{$\begin{array}{c|rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr}
h&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12&13&14&15&16&17&18\\ \hline
\#&1&104&812&5437&51409&237423&735450&1431226&1132756&236752&34910&3076&521&49&8
\end{array}$}
```
The report’s first case at its maximal observed length $`18`$ is $`B=917`$ at start $`\ell=2980`$, with endpoint jump index $`6179`$, window base $`18139852800000000`$, forcing $`13196471407660025821045`$, residue $`76322101735`$ and bound $`3896420420`$. An earlier archived run of the same checker over $`B\le1000`$ coprime to $`30`$ and $`100\le\ell\le500`$ reports $`106{,}666`$ pairs with maximal first successful length $`14`$, whose first case is $`B=359`$ at start $`291`$, endpoint jump index $`627`$, base $`5038848000000`$, forcing $`25864575212865807`$, residue $`213175287`$ and bound $`15932659`$.

These histograms concern a bounded region. The window-growth law gives a necessary lower bound on a possible escape length, not a distribution law for residues or first successful lengths. No generic-residue model is used as evidence for cofinal escape.

# Mathematical result and evidence map

The old corpus-wide ranking and result-population metadata are preserved verbatim in the accompanying archive, not treated as mathematical evidence. The reader-facing dependencies are as follows.

<div class="center">

| Result | Dependency and limit |
|:---|:---|
| Height and cells | Prime-power divisibility and unique factorisation. Their geometry alone gives no irrationality statement. |
| Two-prime values | Earlier factorisation plus the cited external Hecke–Mahler value theorem; not formalised here. |
| Arbitrary-order rank | Diagonal rescaling, separate one-dimensional densities and a staircase determinant; selected supplied formal evidence. |
| Actual tail | Literal multiplicities, half-height normalisation and convergence; an abstract recurrence would not identify the value. |
| Rationality bridge | Strict endpoint clearing and a valid integral carry cap. Exact onset is an ordinary refinement. |
| Window equivalence | The actual recurrence, valid cap and octic window growth; the cofinal escape itself is unproved. |
| Boundary analysis | Exact weighted reindexing and strip decomposition; the finite cubic counterexample has a replayable integer witness. |
| Finite evidence | Individual checked witnesses certify only their stated windows; large missing-witness reports remain archival. |

</div>

A source location, a successful build receipt, a selected formal statement, an axiom audit and a finite execution receipt answer different questions. No global registry population or editorial rank supplies any of them.
