# Multiplicative Obstructions at Base 3/2

*Lean-checked exclusions for the linear-form approach to Erdős Problem #1049*

<a id="abstract"></a>

## Abstract

Let $`F(t)=\sum_{n\ge1}(t^{n}-1)^{-1}`$. At the rational base $`3/2`$ we prove exclusions for the approach to irrationality by integer linear forms, and formalise them in Lean. Rowwise content (the greatest common divisor of the two entries of a coefficient row) scales the analytic error and the exterior determinant by exactly the same factors, including the absolute determinant height, so a local divisor supplied only by the two row contents is paid for by exactly the same factor in the Archimedean determinant height. Homogeneous specialisation at $`(3,2)`$ sees the constant endpoint modulo $`3`$ and the top endpoint modulo $`2`$, so unit endpoints exclude both primes from any common divisor. Together: when one entry of a coefficient pair has a unit top endpoint and the other a unit constant endpoint, neither rowwise scalar content nor a common divisor of the two specialised evaluations can manufacture the two local primes required at $`3/2`$. The missing local gain must therefore survive primitive normalisation. What remains is a growing-rank additive kernel cancelling both endpoint jets (the residues of a specialised coefficient modulo $`3^{R}`$ and modulo $`2^{S}`$) in both specialised coefficient sequences while preserving a nonzero, sufficiently small remainder; we count the four-jet target exactly and prove the concrete sufficient threshold $`M\ge 4R+2S`$ on the number $`M`$ of coefficient pairs, at positive bottom depth $`R`$.

We also record what a direct clearing route costs. Erdős’s actual 1948 integer-base proof instead constructs, by the Chinese remainder theorem, arbitrarily long blocks of zero base-$`b`$ digits and proves that the expansion does not terminate \[erdos1948, pp. 63–66\]. The separate cut-level clearing studied here leaves a factor $`s^{N+1}`$ behind at a rational base $`r/s`$ with $`s\ge2`$. Writing a coordinatewise corridor for the surviving arithmetic, we prove that a corridor forces $`s^{N+K+1}<r(N+K)`$, and that at the base $`3/2`$ this is impossible once the shift and the cleared window are both nonempty. We also prove the exact denominator-cleared tail recurrence $`U_{N+1}=rU_N-Bc(N+1)s^{N+1}`$ and the bound $`2^{N+1}\le Bc(N+1)s^{N+1}`$ for $`s\ge2`$ and positive data, against the exact collapse of that term to $`Bc(N+1)`$ at $`s=1`$. The height criterion of Bundschuh and Väänänen (1994), which settles a restricted family of rational bases containing $`7/2`$, is used as an external theorem. We formalise the complete elementary Archimedean height inequality required at $`7/2`$, while leaving the source theorem’s analytic irrationality argument external. Separately we check polynomial bounds on the denominator exponents of a homogenised Padé construction, with the analytic remainder left untouched.

Problem #1049 is open, and nothing here decides it. The results are exclusions of particular constructions, not statements about the arithmetic nature of any value: we do not prove irrationality at $`3/2`$, at any other rational base, or in the unrestricted problem.

# Introduction

Let $`t>1`$ be a rational number and let $`\tau(n)`$ count the divisors of $`n`$. Erdős Problem #1049 asks whether
``` math
F(t)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{1}{t^{n}-1}=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\tau(n)}{t^{n}}
```
is irrational \[erdos1988, p. 102\]. The two forms agree by expanding $`(t^{n}-1)^{-1}=\sum_{k\ge1}t^{-nk}`$ and collecting the terms with the same exponent, the coefficient of $`t^{-m}`$ being the number of divisors of $`m`$. The question is a conjecture of Chowla; Erdős proved it for every integer $`t\ge2`$ \[erdos1948\]. Bloom’s current catalogue record reproduces the displayed rational-$`t`$ question, labels it *open*, attributes it to Chowla, and points to Erdős’s 1988 statement on p. 102 and the 1948 integer-base theorem \[erdosproblems\]. The same record warns that its status is the website owner’s current assessment and asks readers to cite the original Erdős sources. Accordingly, the catalogue is used here for numbering and current reported status, while the two original publications carry the mathematical claims. The universal conjecture over all rational $`t>1`$ remains open; individual non-integral rational bases are known, including $`7/2`$ below.

Write $`t=r/s`$ in lowest terms with $`r>s\ge1`$, so that $`s=1`$ is exactly the integer case Erdős settled. The resistant explicit base of least naive height $`H(r/s)=\max(r,s)`$ is $`t=3/2`$. A published height criterion of Bundschuh and Väänänen \[bv1994, Thm. 2, p. 177; hypotheses pp. 175–176\] settles a family of rational bases restricted by a height condition; that family contains $`7/2`$ and does not contain $`3/2`$. Between the two lies the question this note is about: what exactly stops the integer-base argument from running at $`3/2`$?

<a id="relation-to-prior-work."></a>

#### Relation to prior work.

The *Formal Conjectures* file for Problem #1049 contains the conjecture and integer-base theorem as `sorry` placeholders, but it also proves the Lambert identity between the two displayed series for rational $`t`$ \[formalconjectures1049\]. In the present $`t>1`$ regime its `lambert_convergent` branch is an ordinary convergent-series proof; the same file’s $`|t|\le1`$ branch instead uses Lean’s convention that the `tsum` of a nonsummable series is zero. Thus it supplies genuine checked prior art for the identity, but no irrationality theorem. The present note formalises propositions about the clearing argument and likewise does not answer the conjecture. Erdős’s positive-integer theorem of 1948 \[erdos1948\] sits inside a larger integer-base literature. At the level of functions, Rivin proves that if a sequence $`\gamma`$ and its divisor-sum sequence are both eventually linearly recurrent, then $`\gamma`$ is finitely supported \[rivin2026, Theorem 1.1, p. 2; proof pp. 6–7\]. His periodic-coefficient corollary therefore shows that
``` math
\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{z^n}{1-z^n}
```
is not a rational function \[rivin2026, Corollary 6.4, p. 9\]. This is an exact structural statement about the function underlying Problem #1049, but it gives no irrationality statement for a special value at $`z=1/t`$: a nonrational function may take rational values at particular rational points. In 1991 Borwein proved the irrationality of shifted series $`\sum_{n\ge1}(t^{n}+w)^{-1}`$ at integer bases $`t\ge2`$, for every nonzero rational $`w`$ with $`w\ne-t^m`$ for all $`m\ge1`$, by Padé approximation rather than by digit clearing; his estimates also show that these values are not Liouville numbers \[borwein1991, Thm. 4, pp. 257–258\]. In 2001 Van Assche recovered the integer-base irrationality and the bound $`\mu(F(p))\le 2\pi^2/(\pi^2-2)=2.50828\ldots`$ using little $`q`$-Legendre Padé approximants  \[vanassche2001, Thm. 1, p. 10; proof pp. 10–11\]. His more general Theorem 3 proves irrationality of $`\sum_{k\ge1}(cp^k-1)^{-1}`$ for an integer $`p>1`$ and fixed rational $`c`$ away from the poles \[vanassche2001, Thm. 3, p. 14\]; it does not cover a rational noninteger base $`t`$ in $`F(t)`$, because the multiplier needed to write $`t^k`$ over an integer base varies with $`k`$. In 2013 Vandehey proved that $`\sum_{n\ge1}d(n)a_n/b^n`$ is irrational whenever $`b>1`$ is an integer and $`(a_n)`$ ranges in a finite integer alphabet excluding zero; taking $`a_n=(-1)^n`$ completes the elementary digit method for integer bases $`b\le-2`$ \[vandehey2013, Thm. 1.2, p. 2\]. His companion theorem permits a finite alphabet of nonnegative integers containing zero, provided the coefficient sequence is not eventually zero \[vandehey2013, Thm. 1.1, p. 2\]. All three retain an integer base. In 2004 Zudilin obtained the uniform bound $`\mu(F(p))\le2.46497868\ldots`$ for every integer $`p\notin\{0,\pm1\}`$, by way of Heine’s basic transform and a permutation group \[zudilin2004, Thm. 1, p. 154; Secs. 4–5, pp. 159–162\]. The ordinary-hypergeometric antecedent is Rhin and Viola’s $`S_5`$ action and twelve-coset denominator reduction for rational forms in $`\zeta(2)`$ \[rhinviola1996, Sec. 3, pp. 38–42; Sec. 4, pp. 46–51\]. Those sources motivate the permutation, denominator and polynomial- specialisation architecture of Section <a href="#sec:endpoints" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:endpoints">3</a>; the endpoint lemmas there are abstract and are not yet applied to either source’s actual coefficient family. The neighbouring problem of Lambert subseries $`\sum_{n\in A}(t^{n}-1)^{-1}`$ over a restricted index set $`A`$ is treated by Kovač and Tao \[kovactao2024\]. The rational non-integer progress relevant here is instead the height criterion of Bundschuh and Väänänen \[bv1994\]. No claim of priority is made for anything below, which concerns the formal status of an argument rather than a new theorem about $`F(t)`$.

<a id="erdőss-integer-base-argument-in-outline."></a>

#### Erdős’s integer-base argument, in outline.

For an integer $`b\ge2`$, Erdős rewrites $`F(b)=\sum_{n\ge1}\tau(n)b^{-n}`$. A Chinese-remainder construction forces arbitrarily long blocks in which the divisor coefficients have the powers of $`b`$ needed to make the corresponding base-$`b`$ digits zero. Explicit bounds control the middle and far tails, while positivity proves that the expansion does not terminate. The resulting base-$`b`$ expansion has arbitrarily long zero blocks without being eventually zero and is therefore irrational  \[erdos1948, pp. 63–66\].

<a id="the-direct-cut-and-clear-attempt-studied-here."></a>

#### The direct cut-and-clear attempt studied here.

A more naive route is to suppose $`F(b)=p/q`$, cut at $`N`$, and multiply the remaining identity by $`qb^N`$. This does not by itself trap a positive integer below $`1`$: the first uncleared tail contribution is $`q\tau(N+1)/b`$. The sections below isolate additional corridor hypotheses under which a bounded-window version of this route would work, and then show why those hypotheses fail at $`3/2`$.

Write $`\beta=r/s`$ for the base and $`c(n)`$ for the coefficient of $`\beta^{-n}`$, so that $`c=\tau`$ in the case at hand. The term $`c(n)\beta^{-n}`$ is $`c(n)s^{n}/r^{n}`$. Clearing the power of $`r`$ leaves the numerator factor $`s^{n}`$ in place. That factor is invisible when $`s=1`$ and grows geometrically when $`s\ge2`$. At $`3/2`$ it is $`2^{n}`$.

<a id="terminology."></a>

#### Terminology.

The linear-form route works with pairs $`(U,V)`$, of integers or of integer polynomials; following matrix usage we call such a pair a *row*, and its *content* is the greatest common divisor of its two entries. A row of content $`1`$ is *primitive*, and dividing a row by its content is *primitive normalisation*. The *exterior determinant* of two integer rows is $`U_{n}V_{m}-U_{m}V_{n}`$, the determinant of the $`2\times2`$ matrix they form. Two quantities attached to that determinant are compared throughout: an integer dividing it, which is a local gain, and its absolute value, which is an Archimedean cost; we call that comparison the *local-to-Archimedean balance*. The *endpoints* of a coefficient polynomial, taken relative to the declared width $`W`$ of Section <a href="#sec:endpoints" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:endpoints">3</a>, are its constant coefficient and its coefficient at $`W`$; we call these the *constant endpoint* and the *top endpoint*, so the top endpoint is the coefficient at $`W`$ and not the leading coefficient unless the two agree. A *unit* endpoint is one equal to $`\pm1`$, the units of $`\mathbb{Z}`$; Theorem <a href="#res:endpoints" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:endpoints">3</a> is the reason only these two coefficients decide divisibility by $`3`$ and by $`2`$ after specialisation at $`(3,2)`$. A *jet* is a residue of a specialised coefficient modulo a prime power: the bottom jet is its residue modulo $`3^{R}`$ and the top jet its residue modulo $`2^{S}`$, and $`R`$ and $`S`$ are the bottom and top *depths*. A jet vanishes exactly when the prime power in question divides the specialised coefficient.

<a id="the-shortfall-at-32."></a>

#### The shortfall at $`3/2`$.

The elementary route and the linear-form route are both examined below. For the coordinatewise clearing scheme the leftover at each step is the forcing term of an exact recurrence, of size at least $`2^{N+1}`$ whenever $`s\ge2`$ and the scaling constant $`B`$ and the coefficient $`c(N+1)`$ are at least $`1`$ (Theorem <a href="#res:forcing" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:forcing">17</a>), and the scheme itself is excluded at $`3/2`$ for every shift $`N\ge1`$ and every cleared window of width $`K\ge1`$ (Theorem <a href="#res:nocorridor" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:nocorridor">15</a>). For the linear-form constructions the shortfall is the $`2`$-adic and $`3`$-adic gain that has to remain after the coefficient rows have been divided by their contents (Section <a href="#sec:primitive" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:primitive">2</a>). Each multiplicative device examined here for supplying that gain is excluded: rowwise content is exactly neutral, since it scales the exterior determinant and its absolute height by the same factor (Theorem <a href="#res:content" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:content">1</a>), and unit endpoints keep both $`2`$ and $`3`$ out of any common divisor of the two specialised evaluations (Theorem <a href="#res:endpoints" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:endpoints">3</a> and Proposition <a href="#res:commonmult" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:commonmult">5</a>). Corollary <a href="#res:nomult" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:nomult">7</a> states the two together. Separately, the scalar parameter margin is negative under the assumed source inequality (Theorem <a href="#res:scalar" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:scalar">10</a>). The device pursued here instead is additive: an integer relation among rows that cancels the endpoint jets. Theorem <a href="#res:jetkernel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:jetkernel">8</a> shows that a nonzero relation with coefficients in $`\{-1,0,1\}`$ cancelling all four jets exists whenever the bottom depth is positive and the number of coefficient pairs is at least $`4R+2S`$. It does not show that the resulting combination has a nonzero polynomial pair or a nonzero remainder, which is what Problem <a href="#prob:kernel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prob:kernel">22</a> asks for. Sections <a href="#sec:sevenhalves" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:sevenhalves">6</a> and <a href="#sec:pade" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:pade">7</a> record two external routes and what each leaves unproved at $`3/2`$.

<a id="sharpness."></a>

#### Sharpness.

Two questions of scope are worth isolating. The corridor bound of Theorem <a href="#res:corridorbound" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:corridorbound">12</a> is exponential on the left and linear on the right, so for a fixed numerator and any $`s\ge2`$ a corridor can survive only for bounded $`N+K`$; the base $`3/2`$ is the case in which the crossing has already happened at the smallest admissible window, which is why the exclusion there holds for all $`N\ge1`$ and $`K\ge1`$ with no further restriction. The height criterion of \[bv1994\] is restricted by a height condition satisfied at $`7/2`$ and not at $`3/2`$, so the two bases are separated by that criterion rather than by anything proved here.

*Status.* The problem treated here is open, and this note does not close it. Every statement below marked as checked is a proposition that the pinned Lean kernel accepts from the sources this note links to, with no `sorry`, no added axiom, and no unchecked evaluation. That is a claim about the formal statement, not about its mathematical interest, its novelty, or the original problem. The unresolved obligations are named exactly, in their own section, and none of the finite computations, reductions, or no-go results here removes one of them.

# Row content does not change the local-to-Archimedean balance

An irrationality argument by linear forms replaces the clearing scheme by explicit rational approximation: one constructs integer linear forms in $`1`$ and $`F(\beta)`$ whose analytic decay outruns the height of their common denominator. For an integer coefficient pair $`(U,V)`$ and a real target $`S`$, put
``` math
L_S(U,V)=US-V,
 \qquad
 \Delta\bigl((U_n,V_n),(U_m,V_m)\bigr)=U_nV_m-U_mV_n.
```
We call $`L_S(U,V)`$ the *error* of the row at $`S`$; a good approximation is one that makes it small. The second expression is the exterior determinant of the two rows, and it eliminates $`S`$ exactly:
``` math
\Delta=U_mL_S(U_n,V_n)-U_nL_S(U_m,V_m).
```
This identity is what makes the determinant useful. Since $`\Delta`$ is an integer, if it does not vanish then
``` math
1\le|\Delta|
  \le|U_m|\,\bigl|L_S(U_n,V_n)\bigr|+|U_n|\,\bigl|L_S(U_m,V_m)\bigr|,
```
and the two errors cannot both be smaller than $`1/(|U_n|+|U_m|)`$. The determinant therefore carries two competing quantities at once, an integer that divides it and its own absolute value, and the theorem below is about how a rescaling moves them.

<div id="res:content" class="theorem">

**Theorem 1** (row-content no-go). *Let $`S`$ be real, let $`(U_n,V_n)`$ and $`(U_m,V_m)`$ be pairs of integers, and let $`c_n,c_m`$ be integers. Then
``` math
L_S(c_nU_n,c_nV_n)=c_nL_S(U_n,V_n),
```
``` math
\Delta\bigl(c_n(U_n,V_n),c_m(U_m,V_m)\bigr)
 =c_nc_m\Delta\bigl((U_n,V_n),(U_m,V_m)\bigr),
```
and consequently
``` math
\left|\Delta\bigl(c_n(U_n,V_n),c_m(U_m,V_m)\bigr)\right|
 =|c_n|\,|c_m|\,
   \left|\Delta\bigl((U_n,V_n),(U_m,V_m)\bigr)\right|.
```
In particular $`c_nc_m`$ divides the scaled determinant. Hence a local divisor supplied only by the two row contents is paid for by exactly the same factor in the Archimedean determinant height.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* All three identities are routine expansions in $`\mathbb{Z}`$ or $`\mathbb{R}`$; the divisibility statement uses the primitive determinant as its witness. ◻

</div>

Informally, Theorem <a href="#res:content" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:content">1</a> says that a common factor introduced into the rows appears twice over: once as a divisor of the exterior determinant, and once as the same factor in the absolute value of that determinant. It moves the local gain and the Archimedean cost by exactly the same amount.

<div id="ex:content" class="example">

**Example 2**. Take $`(U_n,V_n)=(1,2)`$ and $`(U_m,V_m)=(3,5)`$, so that $`\Delta=1\cdot5-3\cdot2=-1`$. Multiplying the first row by $`c_n=6`$ and the second by $`c_m=10`$ gives the rows $`(6,12)`$ and $`(30,50)`$, whose determinant is $`6\cdot50-30\cdot12=-60`$. That determinant is now divisible by $`60`$, which looks like a local gain of $`60`$; and its absolute value has risen from $`1`$ to $`60`$, which is a cost of exactly the same size.

Lean checks the error identity in [error scaling](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L84), the determinant identity in [content factorisation](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L94), the exact absolute-height identity in [absolute determinant scaling](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L104), and the divisor statement in [content-product divisibility](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L116). The elimination identity is the checked [exterior determinant identity](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L124).

The key point is that the two scalings are the same scaling. Each identity on its own is a one-line expansion, and the interest of the theorem is not in any one of them. Taken together they say that the factor $`c_nc_m`$ which a rescaling introduces into the determinant reappears undiminished, as $`|c_n|\,|c_m|`$, in the absolute value of that determinant. The third identity is displayed with absolute values for exactly that reason: it is what makes the statement one about the Archimedean height and not about divisibility alone. Whatever $`c_n`$ and $`c_m`$ are, a rescaling therefore leaves the balance between the local divisor and that height where it was.

The theorem does not construct primitive Padé rows, estimate their remainders, or prove that their exterior determinant is nonzero. It removes one source of apparent gain: multiplying a useful row by a large common integer cannot improve the local-to-Archimedean balance. Every candidate family must first be divided by its rowwise common contents; the required $`2`$-adic and $`3`$-adic gain must remain afterwards. The theorem quantifies over arbitrary integer coefficient pairs, so it applies to the rows of any construction of this shape, whatever produced them.

# Endpoint residues at $`(3,2)`$ and the four-jet kernel

Zudilin’s treatment of $`q`$-harmonic series \[zudilin2004\] builds linear forms of the shape used in Section <a href="#sec:primitive" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:primitive">2</a> out of Heine’s basic transform. What matters here is one feature of that construction: its coefficients are produced as polynomials with integer coefficients, and a numerical base is substituted only at the end. We call these the Heine–Zudilin forms and ask what the substitution at $`3/2`$ does to the two primes $`2`$ and $`3`$. The endpoint and jet arguments below use no property of the construction beyond integrality of those coefficient polynomials, and each of them quantifies over arbitrary elements of $`\mathbb{Z}[X]`$. The exception is Theorem <a href="#res:scalar" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:scalar">10</a> at the end of the section, which concerns the scalar parameters of Zudilin’s cone rather than the coefficient polynomials.

Substituting $`X=3/2`$ into an integer polynomial produces a rational number, and multiplying by a power of $`2`$ clears its denominator. The following evaluation records that cleared numerator, so that all the arithmetic below stays inside $`\mathbb{Z}`$. For $`P(X)=\sum_i p_iX^i\in\mathbb{Z}[X]`$ and a declared width $`W\ge0`$, put
``` math
H_W(P)=\sum_{i=0}^{W}p_i\,3^i2^{W-i}.
```
This is the [homogeneous endpoint evaluation](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L96). It is homogeneous in the sense that $`X^{i}`$ is replaced by $`3^{i}2^{W-i}`$, so the numerator and the denominator of the base are carried symmetrically. When $`W\ge\deg P`$ it is exactly the cleared numerator, since
``` math
\sum_{i=0}^{W}p_i\,3^i2^{W-i}=2^{W}\sum_{i=0}^{W}p_i\left(\tfrac32\right)^{i}
 =2^{W}P\!\left(\tfrac32\right).
```

<div id="res:endpoints" class="theorem">

**Theorem 3** (endpoint residues). *Let $`P=\sum_ip_iX^i\in\mathbb{Z}[X]`$ and let $`W\ge0`$. Then
``` math
H_W(P)\equiv p_0\,2^W\pmod 3,\qquad
 H_W(P)\equiv p_W\,3^W\pmod 2.
```
Consequently a unit constant coefficient prevents divisibility by $`3`$, and a unit coefficient at the declared width $`W`$ prevents divisibility by $`2`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Modulo $`3`$, every summand with $`i>0`$ vanishes; modulo $`2`$, every summand with $`i<W`$ vanishes. The remaining powers are units in the corresponding residue fields. ◻

</div>

Since $`2^{W}`$ is invertible modulo $`3`$ and $`3^{W}`$ is invertible modulo $`2`$, the two congruences say more than the stated consequence: divisibility of $`H_W(P)`$ by $`3`$ is decided by $`p_0`$ alone, and divisibility by $`2`$ by $`p_W`$ alone. The rest of the coefficient vector is invisible to both primes. The coefficient $`p_W`$ is the top coefficient of $`P`$ exactly when $`\deg P=W`$, and is zero when $`\deg P<W`$; the identity $`H_W(P)=2^{W}P(3/2)`$ likewise holds only for $`\deg P\le W`$.

<div id="ex:endpoints" class="example">

**Example 4**. Take $`W=2`$. The three polynomials below differ only at an endpoint.

<div class="center">

| $`P`$      | $`H_2(P)`$                     | $`3\mid H_2(P)`$ | $`2\mid H_2(P)`$ |
|:-----------|:-------------------------------|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| $`X^2+1`$  | $`1\cdot4+0\cdot6+1\cdot9=13`$ |        no        |        no        |
| $`X^2+3`$  | $`3\cdot4+0\cdot6+1\cdot9=21`$ |       yes        |        no        |
| $`2X^2+1`$ | $`1\cdot4+0\cdot6+2\cdot9=22`$ |        no        |       yes        |

</div>

The first has both endpoints equal to $`1`$ and its evaluation, $`13`$, is divisible by neither prime; as a check, $`2^{2}\bigl((3/2)^2+1\bigr)=13`$. The second and third show that each hypothesis is used: spoiling the constant endpoint admits $`3`$, and spoiling the top endpoint admits $`2`$.

</div>

The congruences are the [bottom-endpoint identity](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L201) and [top-endpoint identity](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L215); the unit consequences are the [constant-endpoint obstruction](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L233) and [top-endpoint obstruction](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L251).

The proof is two lines, but the shape of the statement is not incidental. The difficulty lies in the fact that the specialisation sees a different endpoint at each of the two primes: modulo $`3`$ only the constant coefficient survives, and modulo $`2`$ only the top one does. The two exclusions are therefore conditions at opposite ends of the coefficient vector, and the statement below imposes one at each end, on the two entries of a single coefficient pair.

<div id="res:commonmult" class="proposition">

**Proposition 5** (common divisor). *Let $`U,V\in\mathbb{Z}[X]`$ and let $`W\ge0`$. If $`U`$ has unit top endpoint, $`V`$ has unit constant endpoint, and an integer $`c`$ divides both $`H_W(U)`$ and $`H_W(V)`$, then
``` math
2\nmid c\qquad\text{and}\qquad 3\nmid c.
```*

</div>

This is the checked [common-divisor exclusion](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L293). The proposition does not say that the two evaluations are coprime; it says that whatever they share misses both of the primes that matter at $`3/2`$.

<div id="ex:commonmult" class="example">

**Example 6**. Take $`W=2`$, $`U=X^2+3`$ and $`V=5X^2+1`$. The top endpoint of $`U`$ and the constant endpoint of $`V`$ are both $`1`$, and
``` math
H_2(U)=3\cdot4+1\cdot9=21,\qquad H_2(V)=1\cdot4+5\cdot9=49 .
```
Here $`\gcd(21,49)=7`$, so a common divisor does exist and is not small; it is simply coprime to $`6`$.

</div>

<div id="res:nomult" class="corollary">

**Corollary 7** (no gain from row content or a common divisor at $`3/2`$). *Under the endpoint hypotheses of Proposition <a href="#res:commonmult" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:commonmult">5</a>, neither rowwise scalar content nor a common divisor of the two specialised evaluations $`H_W(U)`$ and $`H_W(V)`$ can manufacture the two local primes required at $`3/2`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* By Theorem <a href="#res:content" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:content">1</a> rowwise content multiplies the analytic error and the exterior determinant, including the absolute determinant height, by exactly the factors it introduces, so a divisor obtained that way is paid for by the same factor in that height. By Proposition <a href="#res:commonmult" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:commonmult">5</a> an integer dividing both specialised evaluations is divisible by neither $`2`$ nor $`3`$. ◻

</div>

Both ingredients are Lean-checked; the combination is an ordinary deduction and is not separately formalised. The corollary excludes two ways of producing the required gain. It does not show that a gain of that kind is necessary for a proof by linear forms at $`3/2`$.

Corollary <a href="#res:nomult" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:nomult">7</a> excludes the two multiplicative devices above, and what the rest of this section pursues in their place is additive: rather than multiplying one row by a scalar, take an integer combination of several rows and ask that the combination be divisible where the individual rows are not. The endpoint congruences are the first case of a divisibility condition that can be imposed to any depth, and it is that condition, read additively, which is counted below.

We first raise the two congruences to prime powers. Fix depths $`R,S\ge0`$. For $`P\in\mathbb{Z}[X]`$ the *bottom jet* $`J_{3,R}(P)`$ is the residue of $`H_W(P)`$ modulo $`3^R`$, and the *top jet* $`J_{2,S}(P)`$ is its residue modulo $`2^S`$; Theorem <a href="#res:endpoints" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:endpoints">3</a> computes them at $`R=S=1`$. Their vanishing is exactly the requested divisibility:
``` math
J_{3,R}(P)=0\iff 3^R\mid H_W(P),\qquad
 J_{2,S}(P)=0\iff 2^S\mid H_W(P).
```
These are the checked [bottom-jet divisibility criterion](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L189) and [top-jet divisibility criterion](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L195). The *four-jet signature* of a coefficient pair $`(U,V)`$ is then the quadruple
``` math
\bigl(J_{3,R}(U),J_{3,R}(V),J_{2,S}(U),J_{2,S}(V)\bigr)
 \in(\mathbb{Z}/3^R\mathbb{Z})^2\times(\mathbb{Z}/2^S\mathbb{Z})^2 ,
```
two residues for each of the two primes, one from each entry of the pair. By the displayed criteria it vanishes exactly when $`3^R`$ divides both specialised entries and $`2^S`$ divides both.

This turns the missing local divisor into an additive congruence-kernel problem: what is sought is no longer a common divisor of the two evaluations, but a vector of small integer coefficients on which four residues vanish at once. Since $`H_W`$ is linear in the coefficients of $`P`$, the four-jet signature of a combination is the corresponding combination of signatures, which is what makes the following count possible.

<div id="res:jetkernel" class="theorem">

**Theorem 8** (binary four-jet collision). *Fix a width $`W`$ and depths $`R,S`$, and let $`(U_j,V_j)_{j<M}`$ be any $`M`$ pairs of integral polynomials. Call a subset of $`\{0,\dots,M-1\}`$, equivalently a vector of $`\{0,1\}^M`$, a *binary selector*. If the $`2^M`$ binary selectors outnumber the finite four-jet target
``` math
(\mathbb{Z}/3^R\mathbb{Z})^2\times(\mathbb{Z}/2^S\mathbb{Z})^2,
```
then two distinct subsets have the same four-jet sum. Subtracting their indicator vectors gives a nonzero coefficient vector in $`\{-1,0,1\}^M`$ cancelling all four jets. The target has exact cardinality
``` math
(3^R)^2(2^S)^2.
```
In particular, if $`R>0`$ and $`4R+2S\le M`$, such a collision exists.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Send each binary selector to the sum of the four-jet signatures it selects. The claimed cardinal inequality and the pigeonhole principle give two distinct selectors in the same fibre. The cardinality formula is the product of the four cyclic-modulus cardinalities. For $`R>0`$,
``` math
(3^R)^2(2^S)^2<(4^R)^2(2^S)^2=2^{4R+2S}\le2^M,
```
which proves the stated sufficient threshold. ◻

</div>

The target count is the checked [four-jet target cardinality](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L129); the abstract collision is the checked [four-jet pigeonhole kernel](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L140), and the linear sufficient condition is the checked [rank–depth collision threshold](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L159). The count is a routine pigeonhole; the reformulation above is what makes it relevant. Pigeonhole cancellation itself requires no independence. Independence or a non-collapsed deformation is needed only to ensure that the resulting nonzero selector difference has a nonzero polynomial pair and analytic remainder. None of the statements proved here produces a sufficiently large primitive non-collapsed family, or proves that a collision has nonzero polynomial pair or nonzero remainder.

<div id="ex:jetcount" class="example">

**Example 9**. At depths $`R=S=1`$ the four-jet target is $`(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})^2\times(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^2`$, of cardinality $`9\cdot4=36`$, and the threshold reads $`M\ge4\cdot1+2\cdot1=6`$. With six pairs there are $`2^{6}=64`$ binary selectors against $`36`$ targets, so two of them collide and their difference is a vector in $`\{-1,0,1\}^{6}`$, not identically zero, killing all four jets.

</div>

Informally, the theorem says only this: once there are at least $`4R+2S`$ pairs and the bottom depth $`R`$ is positive, some coefficient vector in $`\{-1,0,1\}^M`$, not identically zero, kills all four jets of the corresponding combination. It does not say that the combination is nonzero as a pair of polynomials, and it does not say that its remainder is nonzero. Those are the two obligations Problem <a href="#prob:kernel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prob:kernel">22</a> carries.

One further exclusion is recorded here. It concerns the scalar parameters of Zudilin’s cone rather than the coefficient polynomials.

<div id="res:scalar" class="theorem">

**Theorem 10** (scalar margin no-go). *Let $`C_1>0`$. If $`C_0\le0`$ or $`2C_0\le C_1`$, then
``` math
C_0\log 3-C_1\log 2<0.
```*

</div>

Written multiplicatively, the conclusion is $`3^{C_0}<2^{C_1}`$. The inequality is immediate from $`\log3<2\log2`$ and $`C_1>0`$, and is the checked [three-halves scalar margin](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L323). The interest is in the fence around it. The primary Zudilin theorem \[zudilin2004, Theorem 1, p. 154; Sec. 5, pp. 161–162\] supplies an integer-base irrationality-exponent estimate on its parameter cone, and the elementary inequality $`\mu\ge2`$ then forces $`2C_0\le C_1`$ whenever $`C_0>0`$; Lean checks that implication separately. The primary theorem assumes an integer base $`p=1/q`$. It does not state a rational $`p=3/2`$ theorem, so the all-scale coefficient construction and rational specialisation remain external to the checked result, which is the scalar parameter margin alone.

# Failure of coordinatewise clearing at $`3/2`$

This section and the next return to the elementary route and record what the residue $`s^{n}`$ costs there. We first isolate the arithmetic that the clearing scheme leaves behind, in a form that does not mention the series. The point of doing so is that the clearing argument asks for two things at once, that a power of the numerator divide what has been accumulated and that what survives be small, and these are easier to play off against each other once the series has been discarded and only six natural numbers remain.

<div id="def:corridor" class="definition">

**Definition 11** (coordinatewise corridor). Let $`a,b,N,K,Q,D`$ be natural numbers. Say that $`(a,b,N,K,Q,D)`$ is a *coordinatewise corridor* when
``` math
a>0,\qquad Q>0,\qquad D>0,\qquad D\le N+K,\qquad
 a^{K}\mid QD,\qquad Q\,b^{\,N+K+1}<a^{\,K+1}.
```

</div>

The reading is: $`a`$ and $`b`$ are the numerator and denominator of the base, playing the roles of $`r`$ and $`s`$ in the introduction, so that $`(a,b)=(3,2)`$ is the case of interest; $`N`$ is the shift, $`K`$ is the width of the cleared window, $`Q`$ is the accumulated clearing factor, and $`D`$ is the final coefficient being cleared. The bound $`D\le N+K`$ is the only property of the coefficient used; for the divisor-counting coefficient it holds because $`\tau(n)\le n`$. The divisibility $`a^{K}\mid QD`$ is the requirement that clearing succeeded coordinatewise, and the last inequality is the tail estimate that makes the trapped integer smaller than $`1`$. The name records the shape of the constraint: the divisibility bounds $`a^{K}`$ from above by $`Q(N+K)`$, the tail estimate bounds $`a^{K+1}`$ from below by $`Q\,b^{\,N+K+1}`$, and admissible parameters must fit in the band between them. The definition is the [corridor predicate](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L106).

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* A routine divisibility computation. Since $`QD>0`$ and $`a^{K}\mid QD`$, we have $`a^{K}\le QD`$, and $`D\le N+K`$ gives $`a^{K}\le Q(N+K)`$. Hence
``` math
Q\,b^{\,N+K+1}<a^{\,K+1}=a^{K}\cdot a\le Q(N+K)\cdot a,

The inequality of Theorem <a href="#res:corridorbound" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:corridorbound">12</a> is where the integer and rational cases part. At $`b=1`$ it reads $`1<a(N+K)`$, which holds for every $`a\ge2`$ and every nonempty window; the corridor imposes no obstruction at all. At $`b\ge2`$ the left side is exponential in $`N+K`$ and the right side is linear, so the corridor can survive only for small $`N+K`$. At $`b=2`$ the crossing has already happened at the smallest admissible window.

<div id="ex:corridor" class="example">

**Example 13**. Take the smallest window, $`N=K=1`$, and numerator $`a=3`$. At $`b=1`$ the tuple $`(3,1,1,1,3,1)`$ is a corridor: $`D=1\le2`$, the divisibility reads $`3\mid3`$, and the tail estimate reads $`3\cdot1^{3}=3<3^{2}=9`$. At $`b=2`$ no choice works. The tail estimate becomes $`Q\cdot2^{3}<3^{2}`$, which forces $`Q=1`$; the divisibility then reads $`3\mid D`$, and the only candidates are $`D=1`$ and $`D=2`$, neither divisible by $`3`$.

# The cleared-tail recurrence and the size of the forcing term

Theorem <a href="#res:nocorridor" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:nocorridor">15</a> says that one scheme fails. This section identifies the quantity responsible, as an exact recurrence.

Let $`r,s,B,F`$ be rationals with $`r\ne0`$ and let $`c:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{Q}`$ be arbitrary. Define the prefix and the cleared tail state by
``` math
P_N=\sum_{m=0}^{N-1}\frac{c(m+1)\,s^{\,m+1}}{r^{\,m+1}},

 U_N=B\,r^{N}\bigl(F-P_N\bigr).

Thus $`P_N`$ is the partial sum of $`\sum_{n\ge1}c(n)(s/r)^{n}`$ through level $`N`$, and $`U_N`$ is the tail of a putative value $`F`$ after that level, scaled by $`Br^{N}`$.

*Proof.* An immediate computation. Expanding $`P_{N+1}=P_N+c(N+1)s^{N+1}/r^{N+1}`$ and $`r^{N+1}=r^{N}\cdot r`$ in the definition of $`U_{N+1}`$ and clearing the denominator $`r^{N+1}`$, which is nonzero, gives the identity. ◻

Formalised as the [cleared-tail recurrence](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L180).

The recurrence has a linear part $`rU_N`$ and a forcing term $`Bc(N+1)s^{N+1}`$, the inhomogeneous term the state receives at each step. The direct-clearing route studied here works only if the state remains in a bounded window, and the forcing term is what that window must absorb. Its size is what separates the two denominator regimes.

<div id="res:forcing" class="theorem">

**Theorem 17** (the forcing term). *Let $`s,B`$ be natural numbers and $`c:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}`$, and put $`G_N=B\,c(N+1)\,s^{\,N+1}`$.*

1.  *If $`s\ge2`$, $`B\ge1`$ and $`c(N+1)\ge1`$, then $`2^{\,N+1}\le G_N`$.*

2.  *If $`s=1`$, then $`G_N=B\,c(N+1)`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Both parts are routine. For the first, $`2^{N+1}\le s^{N+1}=1\cdot s^{N+1}\le Bc(N+1)s^{N+1}`$, using $`B\,c(N+1)\ge1`$. The second part is the definition with $`s=1`$. ◻

</div>

Formalised as the [exponential lower bound](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L197) and the [integer-base collapse](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L211).

At $`s=1`$ the forcing term is $`Bc(N+1)`$, so it grows only as fast as the coefficient; for the divisor function that is $`O(N^{\varepsilon})`$ for every $`\varepsilon>0`$, and a bounded-state argument has room. At $`s\ge2`$ the same term is at least $`2^{N+1}`$ whenever the coefficient is nonzero.

<div id="ex:forcing" class="example">

**Example 18**. Take $`B=1`$, $`c=\tau`$ and $`N=9`$, so that the coefficient is $`\tau(10)=4`$. At $`s=1`$ the forcing term is $`4`$. At $`s=2`$ it is $`4\cdot2^{10}=4096`$, and part (1) of Theorem <a href="#res:forcing" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:forcing">17</a> already guarantees at least $`2^{10}=1024`$ without knowing the coefficient at all.

</div>

This is an exact lower bound on one quantity, and it is all that is proved. It is not a proof that no bounded-state argument exists at $`s\ge2`$; the theorem that one particular scheme fails is Theorem <a href="#res:nocorridor" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:nocorridor">15</a>, and the bound here records the size of the term that scheme would have to absorb.

# The height criterion at $`7/2`$

In 1994 Bundschuh and Väänänen proved an irrationality criterion for a family of rational bases cut out by a height condition \[bv1994, Theorem 2, p. 177; hypotheses pp. 175–176\]. We keep their notation: $`q`$ is the base, and $`\alpha`$ and $`\lambda`$ are the parameters of the criterion. In its special case $`\alpha=-1`$, the printed hypothesis is
``` math
\lambda<\left(\frac12+\frac1{\pi^2}\right)^{-1}.
```
At $`q=7/2`$ the Archimedean parameter is $`\lambda=\log 7/\log(7/2)`$. The criterion therefore applies once the following strict inequality is checked.

<div id="res:sevenhalves" class="theorem">

**Theorem 19** (the $`7/2`$ height condition).
*``` math
\frac{\log 7}{\log(7/2)}
 <
 \left(\frac12+\frac1{\pi^2}\right)^{-1}.
```*

</div>

Numerically the two sides are $`1.5533\ldots`$ and $`1.6630\ldots`$, so the condition holds with a margin of about $`0.11`$. The Lean proof factors the estimate into the [integer certificate](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L32) $`2^{18}<7^7`$, the resulting [logarithmic ratio bound](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L41) $`\log2/\log7<7/18`$, the [$`\pi`$-bound](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L57) $`1/\pi^2<1/9`$, and the [strict margin](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L66)
``` math
\frac{\log2}{\log7}<\frac12-\frac1{\pi^2}.
```
The [final height inequality](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L76) then rewrites $`\log(7/2)=\log7-\log2`$ and closes the displayed condition.

This formalises the complete elementary parameter check at $`q=7/2`$; it does not formalise Bundschuh and Väänänen’s analytic irrationality theorem, whose proof occupies pp. 189–193 of the source. The conclusion that $`F(7/2)`$ is irrational is consequently cited from that theorem, not claimed as a Lean theorem here.

The criterion does not cover $`3/2`$, and the results of Sections <a href="#sec:corridor" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:corridor">4</a> and <a href="#sec:tail" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:tail">5</a> give no evidence either way about whether $`F(3/2)`$ is irrational.

# Denominator exponents for a homogenised Padé construction

A second external route builds the linear forms of Section <a href="#sec:primitive" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:primitive">2</a> by Padé approximation. Such a construction produces its coefficients as sums of rational summands, and to obtain integer rows one multiplies through by a single common denominator. The bookkeeping obligation is then to check that no summand needs a larger denominator than the one proposed, which is a comparison between the exponents alone. This section does that comparison, and only that.

No source construction is named here for the exponent expressions below, and they are checked as displayed polynomial identities rather than derived. Giving them Padé-theoretic force would additionally require deriving the expressions from a stated homogenised coefficient formula, proving integrality of the coefficients after multiplication by the proposed common denominator, and establishing nonvanishing and decay of the associated remainder. None of those three is claimed here.

For a homogenised construction over integer parameters the proposed common denominator exponent is $`E_n=(3n^{2}-n)/2`$. Since only doubled exponents occur below, every statement lives over $`\mathbb{Z}`$ and no parity bookkeeping is needed; we write $`\widetilde{E}_n=2E_n=3n^{2}-n`$.

<div id="res:pade" class="proposition">

**Proposition 20** (summand bound and exact gap). *Let $`\widetilde{E}_n=3n^{2}-n`$ and put
``` math
\widetilde{P}(n,k)=2\bigl(k(n-k)+nk\bigr)+k(k-1),
```
``` math
\widetilde{Q}(n,m)=2(n^{2}-n)+j^{2}+2jm+j-m^{2}+3m,
 \qquad j=n-m-1 .
```
Then, for integers $`n,k,m`$:*

1.  *if $`0\le k\le n`$, then $`\widetilde{P}(n,k)\le\widetilde{E}_n`$, and the gap factors as $`\widetilde{E}_n-\widetilde{P}(n,k)=(n-k)(3n-k-1)`$;*

2.  *$`\widetilde{E}_n-\widetilde{Q}(n,m)=2\bigl(n+m(m-1)\bigr)`$ identically;*

3.  *if $`n\ge0`$ and $`m\ge1`$, then $`\widetilde{Q}(n,m)\le\widetilde{E}_n`$.*

</div>

Part (1) is the [summand exponent bound](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L30), part (2) the [exact gap identity](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L52), and part (3) the [maximal exponent bound](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/08d83b6689c85fc501f4051960d4c35bddb0f431/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L60). The gap in (2) is an identity in $`\mathbb{Z}[n,m]`$, so (3) follows from $`m(m-1)\ge0`$ and $`n\ge0`$; the hypothesis $`m\ge1`$ names the range in which the corresponding summand does not vanish, and it is not the sharpest hypothesis under which the inequality holds.

<div id="ex:pade" class="example">

**Example 21**. At $`n=2`$ the proposed doubled exponent is $`\widetilde{E}_2=10`$, and $`\widetilde{P}(2,k)`$ takes the values $`0,6,10`$ at $`k=0,1,2`$. The three gaps are $`10,4,0`$, matching the factorisation $`(2-k)(5-k)`$ of part (1); the summand at $`k=2`$ is the one that saturates the proposed denominator. For part (2), at $`m=1`$ we have $`j=0`$ and $`\widetilde{Q}(2,1)=6`$, with gap $`4=2\bigl(2+1\cdot0\bigr)`$.

</div>

These are routine inequalities between polynomials in the exponents. They establish that the proposed exponent $`\widetilde{E}_n`$ dominates the two displayed summand exponent expressions, and nothing further. Positivity of the remainder, its rate of decay, and the comparison of that rate against the denominator height are the analytic obligations, and none of them is treated here, so nothing in this section is an irrationality measure.

<a id="sec:open"></a>

# Complements and further questions

Problem #1049 is open. The following is the exact statement that a construction at $`3/2`$ would have to supply. Theorem <a href="#res:jetkernel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:jetkernel">8</a> supplies the combinatorial step: at depths $`R,S`$ with $`R>0`$, once at least $`4R+2S`$ pairs are in hand, a coefficient vector on which all four jets vanish exists. What the problem adds is that those pairs be primitive-normalised Heine–Zudilin pairs drawn from a family that does not degenerate, that the depths grow quadratically, and that the resulting remainder be nonzero with a local gain beating the Archimedean height.

<div id="prob:kernel" class="problem">

**Problem 22** (growing-rank simultaneous endpoint-jet kernel). For positive quadratic target depths $`R_n,S_n`$, exhibit at least $`4R_n+2S_n`$ *primitive-normalised* Heine–Zudilin coefficient pairs from a genuinely non-collapsed deformation, and prove that at least one resulting checked collision satisfies
``` math
J_{3,R_n}\!\left(\sum_j\lambda_jU_j\right)=
 J_{3,R_n}\!\left(\sum_j\lambda_jV_j\right)=0,
\qquad
 J_{2,S_n}\!\left(\sum_j\lambda_jU_j\right)=
 J_{2,S_n}\!\left(\sum_j\lambda_jV_j\right)=0,
```
where $`R_n,S_n`$ have the required quadratic order, while the resulting remainder is nonzero and its local gain beats the Archimedean height. The checked collision already has coefficients in $`\{-1,0,1\}`$. A rank-saturated contiguous-shift family or a genuinely independent deformation would be a first candidate.

</div>

Rescaling a row along a ray, letting the row contents grow, or computing a further common divisor of the two specialised evaluations does not address the obstruction that survives Corollary <a href="#res:nomult" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:nomult">7</a>; each is one of the two devices excluded there, and what Problem <a href="#prob:kernel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prob:kernel">22</a> asks for is additive. Devices outside that corollary are not addressed either way: inserting a multiplicative cyclotomic factor changes the coefficient polynomials rather than scaling a row, and cross-row common factors, determinant-specific arithmetic, additive combinations, and a different architecture all lie outside the two devices it excludes. A theorem showing that every available family is too small or too degenerate to meet the requirements of Problem <a href="#prob:kernel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prob:kernel">22</a> would show that no argument of this shape can succeed.

The unrestricted question, which rational bases give an irrational value, remains open, and is not reduced to the problem above.

# Guide to the formal sources

Each linked phrase opens its Lean declaration at the pinned source revision 08d83b6689c8. The declarations of this note live in three modules: the corridor, the cleared-tail recurrence, and the two arithmetic certificates in the first; the Padé exponent arithmetic in the second; and the Heine–Zudilin endpoint arithmetic in the third. The link coordinates are validated against that pinned revision, so they remain correct as later work moves lines in the working tree.
