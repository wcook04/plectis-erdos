# Sharp Height and Four-Jet Obstructions at Base 3/2

<div class="center">

<span class="smallcaps">Abstract</span>

</div>

Let
``` math
F(t)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac1{t^n-1}.
```
Erdős Problem #1049 asks whether $`F(t)`$ is irrational for every rational $`t>1`$. The problem remains open, and this paper proves no irrationality result at $`t=3/2`$.

The main exact input is
``` math
2^{64}<3^{41}<2^{65}.
```
It yields a uniform gap greater than $`3/13`$ between $`\log 2/\log 3`$ and every threshold in the rectangular Hermite–Padé exponent model considered here. It also shows that the scalar factor, and the scalar factor together with the universally forced first-order border, fall short of the required $`39/41`$ charge. These inequalities exclude the stated height mechanisms only; they do not exclude other Padé or determinant constructions.

The same bracket sharpens a finite four-jet count. At bottom depth $`R=41T`$, any $`M\ge130T+2S`$ integral polynomial pairs have two binary selectors with the same two endpoint jets in both coordinates. For $`T=1`$ this counting threshold is exact. A bounded-fibre lemma shows how a uniform bound on analytic-remainder multiplicities would force one collision outside the remainder nullspace. No such bound is proved for an actual $`q`$-Apéry or Zudilin family. Under the additional hypothesis that adjacent minors vanish and the second coordinates are units, a Bézout shear reduces the sufficient selector width from $`2S+4R`$ to $`S+2R`$.

Two further obstructions explain why direct integer-base arguments do not transfer automatically to $`3/2`$. Integer scalar content scales local divisibility and Archimedean determinant height by the same factor, while unit endpoint coefficients keep both $`2`$ and $`3`$ out of a common divisor after specialisation. A six-condition coordinatewise clearing scheme forces $`s^{N+K+1}<r(N+K)`$; at $`r/s=3/2`$ this is impossible for every $`N,K\ge1`$. The exact cleared-tail recurrence contains the forcing term $`Bc(N+1)s^{N+1}`$, which is at least $`2^{N+1}`$ when $`s\ge2`$ and the integer data are positive.

For comparison, Bundschuh and Väänänen’s published criterion proves irrationality for a restricted rational-base family containing $`7/2`$; only its elementary height check is formalised here. The Padé exponent bounds and the $`81/200`$ logarithmic-region calculations below likewise supply no analytic remainder estimate at $`3/2`$. The unresolved task is to construct a primitive, noncollapsed approximation family whose endpoint divisibility survives normalisation, whose selected polynomial pair and remainder are nonzero, and whose decay beats its height.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What the paper rules out**

**Exact arithmetic.** The bracket $`2^{64}<3^{41}<2^{65}`$ excludes the stated scalar and first-order Hermite–Padé height mechanisms at $`3/2`$. It also yields the sharp finite four-jet count at bottom depth $`41`$, with a Bézout–Plücker reduction under explicit minor and unit hypotheses. **Transfer obstruction.** Direct integer-base clearing fails by an exact growth inequality and forcing recurrence. **Open boundary.** No primitive noncollapsed approximation family with a sufficiently small nonzero remainder is constructed, so no irrationality at $`3/2`$ is proved.

# Introduction

Let $`t>1`$ be a rational number and let $`\tau(n)`$ count the divisors of $`n`$. Erdős Problem #1049 asks whether
``` math
F(t)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{1}{t^{n}-1}=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\tau(n)}{t^{n}}
```
is irrational \[erdos1988, p. 102\].

The two forms agree by expanding $`(t^{n}-1)^{-1}=\sum_{k\ge1}t^{-nk}`$ and collecting the terms with the same exponent, the coefficient of $`t^{-m}`$ being the number of divisors of $`m`$. The question is a conjecture of Chowla; Erdős proved it for every integer $`t\ge2`$ \[erdos1948\]. Bloom’s current catalogue record reproduces the displayed rational-$`t`$ question, labels it *open*, attributes it to Chowla, and points to Erdős’s 1988 statement on p. 102 and the 1948 integer-base theorem \[erdosproblems\]. The same record warns that its status is the website owner’s current assessment and asks readers to cite the original Erdős sources. Accordingly, the catalogue is used here for numbering and current reported status, while the two original publications carry the mathematical claims. The universal conjecture over all rational $`t>1`$ remains open; individual non-integral rational bases are known, including $`7/2`$ below.

Write $`t=r/s`$ in lowest terms with $`r>s\ge1`$, so that $`s=1`$ is exactly the integer case Erdős settled. The resistant explicit base of least naive height $`H(r/s)=\max(r,s)`$ is $`t=3/2`$. A published height criterion of Bundschuh and Väänänen \[bv1994, Thm. 2, p. 177; hypotheses pp. 175–176\] settles a family of rational bases restricted by a height condition; that family contains $`7/2`$ and does not contain $`3/2`$. Between the two lies the question this note is about: what exactly stops the integer-base argument from running at $`3/2`$?

<a id="relation-to-prior-work."></a>

#### Relation to prior work.

The *Formal Conjectures* file for Problem #1049 contains the conjecture and integer-base theorem as `sorry` placeholders, but it also proves the Lambert identity between the two displayed series for rational $`t`$ \[formalconjectures1049\]. In the present $`t>1`$ regime its `lambert_convergent` branch is an ordinary convergent-series proof; the same file’s $`|t|\le1`$ branch instead uses Lean’s convention that the `tsum` of a nonsummable series is zero. Thus it supplies genuine checked prior art for the identity, but no irrationality theorem. The present note formalises propositions about the clearing argument and likewise does not answer the conjecture.

Erdős’s positive-integer theorem of 1948 \[erdos1948\] sits inside a larger integer-base literature. At the level of functions, Rivin proves that if a sequence $`\gamma`$ and its divisor-sum sequence are both eventually linearly recurrent, then $`\gamma`$ is finitely supported \[rivin2026, Theorem 1.1, p. 2; proof pp. 6–7\]. His periodic-coefficient corollary therefore shows that
``` math
\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{z^n}{1-z^n}
```
is not a rational function \[rivin2026, Corollary 6.4, p. 9\]. This is an exact structural statement about the function underlying Problem #1049, but it gives no irrationality statement for a special value at $`z=1/t`$: a nonrational function may take rational values at particular rational points.

In 1991 Borwein proved the irrationality of shifted series $`\sum_{n\ge1}(t^{n}+w)^{-1}`$ at integer bases $`t\ge2`$, for every nonzero rational $`w`$ with $`w\ne-t^m`$ for all $`m\ge1`$, by Padé approximation rather than by digit clearing; his estimates also show that these values are not Liouville numbers \[borwein1991, Thm. 4, pp. 257–258\]. In 2001 Van Assche recovered the integer-base irrationality and the bound $`\mu(F(p))\le 2\pi^2/(\pi^2-2)=2.50828\ldots`$ using little $`q`$-Legendre Padé approximants  \[vanassche2001, Thm. 1, p. 10; proof pp. 10–11\]. His more general Theorem 3 proves irrationality of $`\sum_{k\ge1}(cp^k-1)^{-1}`$ for an integer $`p>1`$ and fixed rational $`c`$ away from the poles \[vanassche2001, Thm. 3, p. 14\]; it does not cover a rational noninteger base $`t`$ in $`F(t)`$, because the multiplier needed to write $`t^k`$ over an integer base varies with $`k`$.

The same Lambert value was already the target of Amdeberhan and Zeilberger’s $`q`$-WZ construction \[az1998\]. Here $`p>1`$ is the integer-base parameter and the little-$`q`$ kernel uses $`q=p^{-1}`$. The two constructions share that bivariate little-$`q`$-Legendre Padé kernel, but Van Assche’s diagonal does not satisfy the Amdeberhan–Zeilberger scalar recurrence. Their Theorems 1 and 2 do prove, respectively, the irrationality of the non-alternating $`h_p(1)`$ and alternating $`q`$-logarithm values for their stated integer parameters, with reported irrationality measure $`4.80`$; those are external integer-parameter results and do not transfer to the rational noninteger base $`3/2`$ studied here.

Amdeberhan–Zeilberger use the moving diagonal $`P_n(p^{n+1}\mid p^{-1})`$, whereas Van Assche uses $`P_n(p^n\mid p^{-1})`$. Van Assche also records, citing Borwein’s 1992 Lemma 2, the neighbouring evaluation $`P_{n-1}(c p^{n+1}\mid p^{-1})`$ \[borwein1992; vanassche2001\]. The shared kernel therefore does not license transfer of recurrence, endpoint, lattice, or valuation claims between the diagonals. Indeed, if $`A_n(p)=P_n(p^n\mid p^{-1})`$, exact substitution at $`n=0`$ into the Amdeberhan–Zeilberger operator leaves
``` math
-p(p-1)^2(p+1)(p^5+2p^4+2p^3+2p^2+2),
```
which is nonzero for every real $`p>1`$. One nonzero residual is decisive for non-transfer of that recurrence.

Lean checks the [exact residual factorisation](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/QAperyDiagonalNonEquivalence.lean#L67) and its [nonvanishing for $`p>1`$](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/QAperyDiagonalNonEquivalence.lean#L94). These are finite statements at $`n=0`$; they do not supply a recurrence for either diagonal. No recurrence, endpoint, lattice, or valuation statement for one diagonal is used for the other; the displayed exact residual is the sole claim made here about their incompatibility.

There is a second distinction at rational base $`3/2`$. Over the checked range, the raw rational approximation errors decrease while the selected cleared integer forms grow from $`n\ge2`$. This says that the chosen integerisation does not produce small linear forms; it does *not* say that the raw approximants fail to converge.

In 2013 Vandehey proved that $`\sum_{n\ge1}d(n)a_n/b^n`$ is irrational whenever $`b>1`$ is an integer and $`(a_n)`$ ranges in a finite integer alphabet excluding zero; taking $`a_n=(-1)^n`$ completes the elementary digit method for integer bases $`b\le-2`$ \[vandehey2013, Thm. 1.2, p. 2\]. His companion theorem permits a finite alphabet of nonnegative integers containing zero, provided the coefficient sequence is not eventually zero \[vandehey2013, Thm. 1.1, p. 2\]. All three retain an integer base. Luca and Tachiya’s periodic-coefficient theorem likewise proves irrationality at every integer base of absolute value greater than one; their full-support example strengthens this to joint linear independence for finite families of iterated divisor functions \[lucatachiya2017, Theorem A, p. 139; Example 1, p. 140\]. This is strong integer-base evidence, but it does not cover a rational noninteger base.

In 2004 Zudilin obtained the uniform bound $`\mu(F(p))\le2.46497868\ldots`$ for every integer $`p\notin\{0,\pm1\}`$, by way of Heine’s basic transform and a permutation group \[zudilin2004, Thm. 1, p. 154; Secs. 4–5, pp. 159–162\]. The ordinary-hypergeometric antecedent is Rhin and Viola’s $`S_5`$ action and twelve-coset denominator reduction for rational forms in $`\zeta(2)`$ \[rhinviola1996, Sec. 3, pp. 38–42; Sec. 4, pp. 46–51\].

Those sources motivate the permutation, denominator and polynomial- specialisation architecture of Section <a href="#sec:endpoints" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:endpoints">4</a>; the endpoint lemmas there are abstract and are not yet applied to either source’s actual coefficient family.

The neighbouring problem of Lambert subseries $`\sum_{n\in A}(t^{n}-1)^{-1}`$ over a restricted index set $`A`$ is treated by Kovač and Tao \[kovactao2024\].

The rational non-integer progress relevant here is instead the height criterion of Bundschuh and Väänänen \[bv1994\], which remains the strongest explicit numerical threshold among the sources compared here for this value. Zudilin’s later Padé-and-Hankel treatment also admits non-integral rational bases: its generalized $`q`$-logarithm remarks that its results also hold for non-integer $`p=r/s`$ with $`|p|>1`$, under an assumption $`\log|r|>c\log|s|`$ for some computable $`c>0`$ \[zudilin2016\]. No value of $`c`$ is computed there, and we do not compute one; we record the remark because it shows the rational-base extension was already contemplated, and because any threshold of that shape is a statement about $`\log s/\log r`$ of exactly the kind Section <a href="#sec:sevenhalves" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:sevenhalves">7</a> treats. No claim of priority is made for the analysis below. It records the formal status and limits of the argument; it does not add a theorem about $`F(t)`$.

<a id="erdőss-integer-base-argument-in-outline."></a>

#### Erdős’s integer-base argument, in outline.

For an integer $`b\ge2`$, Erdős rewrites $`F(b)=\sum_{n\ge1}\tau(n)b^{-n}`$. A Chinese-remainder construction forces arbitrarily long blocks in which the divisor coefficients have the powers of $`b`$ needed to make the corresponding base-$`b`$ digits zero. Explicit bounds control the middle and far tails, while positivity proves that the expansion does not terminate. The resulting base-$`b`$ expansion has arbitrarily long zero blocks without being eventually zero and is therefore irrational  \[erdos1948, pp. 63–66\].

<a id="the-direct-cut-and-clear-attempt-studied-here."></a>

#### The direct cut-and-clear attempt studied here.

A more naive attempt is to suppose $`F(b)=p/q`$, cut at $`N`$, and multiply the remaining identity by $`qb^N`$. This does not by itself trap a positive integer below $`1`$: the first uncleared tail contribution is $`q\tau(N+1)/b`$. The sections below isolate additional corridor hypotheses under which a bounded-window version of this attempt would work, and then show why those hypotheses fail at $`3/2`$.

Write $`\beta=r/s`$ for the base and $`c(n)`$ for the coefficient of $`\beta^{-n}`$, so that $`c=\tau`$ in the case at hand. The term $`c(n)\beta^{-n}`$ is $`c(n)s^{n}/r^{n}`$. Clearing the power of $`r`$ leaves the numerator factor $`s^{n}`$ in place. That factor is invisible when $`s=1`$ and grows geometrically when $`s\ge2`$. At $`3/2`$ it is $`2^{n}`$.

<a id="terminology."></a>

#### Terminology.

The linear-form method uses polynomial pairs before specialisation and integer pairs afterwards. We reserve *row* for an integer pair $`(U,V)`$. Its *integer scalar content* is $`\gcd(|U|,|V|)`$; a row is *primitive* when this number is $`1`$, and dividing by it is *primitive normalisation*. A polynomial pair may instead have a polynomial common factor in $`\mathbb{Z}[X]`$; that is a different operation and is not called row content here. The *exterior determinant* of two integer rows is $`U_{n}V_{m}-U_{m}V_{n}`$, the determinant of the $`2\times2`$ matrix they form. Two quantities attached to that determinant are compared throughout: an integer dividing it, which is a local gain, and its absolute value, which is an Archimedean cost; we call that comparison the *local-to-Archimedean balance*.

The *endpoints* of a coefficient polynomial, taken relative to the declared width $`W`$ of Section <a href="#sec:endpoints" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:endpoints">4</a>, are its constant coefficient and its coefficient at $`W`$; we call these the *constant endpoint* and the *top endpoint*, so the top endpoint is the coefficient at $`W`$ and not the leading coefficient unless the two agree. A *unit* endpoint is one equal to $`\pm1`$, the units of $`\mathbb{Z}`$; Theorem <a href="#res:endpoints" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:endpoints">6</a> is the reason only these two coefficients decide divisibility by $`3`$ and by $`2`$ after specialisation at $`(3,2)`$. A *jet* is a residue of a specialised coefficient modulo a prime power: the bottom jet is its residue modulo $`3^{R}`$ and the top jet its residue modulo $`2^{S}`$, and $`R`$ and $`S`$ are the bottom and top *depths*. A jet vanishes exactly when the prime power in question divides the specialised coefficient.

<a id="the-shortfall-at-32."></a>

#### The shortfall at $`3/2`$.

The elementary method and the linear-form method are both examined below. For the height argument, the exact bracket $`2^{64}<3^{41}<2^{65}`$ gives a gap greater than $`3/13`$ across the whole admissible rectangular exponent cone and fixes the $`39/41`$ denominator-charge comparison. Neither the source scalar factor nor that factor together with the universally forced first-order residual border reaches the required charge. These comparisons leave higher residual valuations, determinant cancellation, and other integral models untouched. For the additive argument, the same bracket replaces the generic $`4R+2S`$ threshold by $`130T+2S`$ at depth $`R=41T`$ and gives an exact first-row failure at $`T=1`$.

For the coordinatewise clearing scheme the leftover at each step is the forcing term of an exact recurrence, of size at least $`2^{N+1}`$ whenever $`s\ge2`$ and the scaling constant $`B`$ and the coefficient $`c(N+1)`$ are at least $`1`$ (Theorem <a href="#res:forcing" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:forcing">24</a>), and the scheme itself is excluded at $`3/2`$ for every shift $`N\ge1`$ and every cleared window of width $`K\ge1`$ (Theorem <a href="#res:nocorridor" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:nocorridor">22</a>).

For the linear-form constructions we examine two possible sources of $`2`$-adic and $`3`$-adic gain. Integer scalar content is exactly neutral, since it scales the exterior determinant and its absolute height by the same factor (Theorem <a href="#res:content" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:content">4</a>), while unit endpoints keep both $`2`$ and $`3`$ out of any common divisor of the two specialised evaluations (Theorem <a href="#res:endpoints" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:endpoints">6</a> and Proposition <a href="#res:commonmult" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:commonmult">8</a>). Corollary <a href="#res:nomult" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:nomult">10</a> states the two scoped exclusions together; neither is claimed to be necessary for every linear-form proof. Separately, the scalar parameter margin is negative under the assumed source inequality (Theorem <a href="#res:scalar" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:scalar">17</a>).

One candidate pursued here is additive: an integer relation among rows that cancels the endpoint jets. Theorem <a href="#res:jetkernel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:jetkernel">12</a> shows that a nonzero relation with coefficients in $`\{-1,0,1\}`$ cancelling all four jets exists whenever the bottom depth is positive and the number of coefficient pairs is at least $`4R+2S`$. It does not show that the resulting combination has a nonzero polynomial pair or a nonzero remainder. Problem <a href="#prob:kernel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prob:kernel">29</a> gives a precise sufficient specification for that particular candidate architecture, not a necessary condition for solving Problem #1049.

Sections <a href="#sec:sevenhalves" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:sevenhalves">7</a> and <a href="#sec:pade" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:pade">8</a> record two external methods and what each leaves unproved at $`3/2`$.

<a id="sharpness."></a>

#### Sharpness.

Two questions of scope are worth isolating. The corridor bound of Theorem <a href="#res:corridorbound" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:corridorbound">19</a> is exponential on the left and linear on the right, so for a fixed numerator and any $`s\ge2`$ a corridor can survive only for bounded $`N+K`$; the base $`3/2`$ is the case in which the crossing has already happened at the smallest admissible window, which is why the exclusion there holds for all $`N\ge1`$ and $`K\ge1`$ with no further restriction. The height criterion of \[bv1994\] is restricted by a height condition satisfied at $`7/2`$ and not at $`3/2`$, so the two bases are separated by that criterion rather than by a universal obstruction. The exponent $`65`$ in $`3^{41}<2^{65}`$ cannot be replaced by $`64`$. The separate direct comparison $`2^{129}<3^{82}`$ then proves that the integer four-jet threshold is exactly $`130+2S`$ when $`R=41`$: $`129+2S`$ does not suffice.

For $`R=41T`$ with $`T>1`$, the displayed $`130T+2S`$ bound is uniform and sufficient, but no claim of exact optimality at every $`T`$ is made.

*Status.* The problem treated here is open, and this note does not close it. Every statement below marked as checked is a proposition that the pinned Lean kernel accepts from the sources this note links to, with no `sorry`, no added axiom, and no unchecked evaluation. That is a claim about the formal statement, not about its mathematical interest, its novelty, or the original problem. The unresolved obligations are named exactly, in their own section, and none of the finite computations, reductions, or no-go results here removes one of them.

*Companion system context.* The [claim and trust boundary](claim-faithful-publication-systems-paper.pdf#nameddest=systems-trust), [cold-clone route to proof authority](cold-clone-to-proof-receipt.pdf#nameddest=cold-clone-authority), and [public contribution protocol](open-source-mathematics-strategy.pdf#nameddest=strategy-protocol) are described in sibling papers. Those descriptions do not change the mathematical status of this note.

<a id="results-and-boundary."></a>

#### Results and boundary.

The linked Lean declarations establish exact inequalities, congruences, finite collision counts, recurrence identities, and exclusions for the named models. Bundschuh and Väänänen’s irrationality theorem at $`7/2`$, Rivin’s functional nonrationality theorem, and the two-variable Mahler theorem used below remain external results. None of the formal statements proves an irrationality result at a rational noninteger base. At $`3/2`$, the missing step is still an actual primitive approximation family with nonzero remainder and an asymptotic height margin.

# The sharp $`41/65`$ certificate

The numerical obstruction at $`3/2`$ is controlled by one small exact calculation. Writing it out is useful because the upper and lower inequalities play different roles: the upper inequality proves every strict analytic threshold below, while the lower inequality establishes the sharp rational scale. Exact failure of the rank-$`41`$ selector count one row earlier uses the additional integer comparison $`2^{129}<3^{82}`$ below.

The next statement is the source-facing charge comparison. It does not prove the degree ceilings: those come from the scalar factor and the universally forced first-order southeast-border factor in the Zudilin model. It proves that even granting those ceilings, neither extraction reaches the required $`39/41`$ fraction of the raw charge.

Their role is exclusion: scalar content and the forced first-order border do not supply enough charge. Higher residual valuations, determinant cancellation, a different integral model, and irrationality of $`F(3/2)`$ remain open.

<a id="sec:primitive"></a>

# Integer scalar content is neutral

An irrationality argument by linear forms replaces the clearing scheme by explicit rational approximation: one constructs integer linear forms in $`1`$ and $`F(\beta)`$ whose analytic decay outruns the height of their common denominator. For an integer coefficient pair $`(U,V)`$ and a real target $`S`$, put
``` math
L_S(U,V)=US-V,
 \qquad
 \Delta\bigl((U_n,V_n),(U_m,V_m)\bigr)=U_nV_m-U_mV_n.
```
We call $`L_S(U,V)`$ the *error* of the row at $`S`$; a good approximation is one that makes it small. The second expression is the exterior determinant of the two rows, and it eliminates $`S`$ exactly:
``` math
\Delta=U_mL_S(U_n,V_n)-U_nL_S(U_m,V_m).
```

This identity is what makes the determinant useful. Since $`\Delta`$ is an integer, if it does not vanish then
``` math
1\le|\Delta|
  \le|U_m|\,\bigl|L_S(U_n,V_n)\bigr|+|U_n|\,\bigl|L_S(U_m,V_m)\bigr|,
```
and the two errors cannot both be smaller than $`1/(|U_n|+|U_m|)`$. The determinant therefore carries two competing quantities at once, an integer that divides it and its own absolute value, and the theorem below is about how a rescaling moves them.

<div id="res:content" class="theorem">

**Theorem 4** (integer-scalar-content no-go). *Let $`S`$ be real, let $`(U_n,V_n)`$ and $`(U_m,V_m)`$ be pairs of integers, and let $`c_n,c_m`$ be integers. Then
``` math
L_S(c_nU_n,c_nV_n)=c_nL_S(U_n,V_n),
```
``` math
\Delta\bigl(c_n(U_n,V_n),c_m(U_m,V_m)\bigr)
 =c_nc_m\Delta\bigl((U_n,V_n),(U_m,V_m)\bigr),
```
and consequently
``` math
\left|\Delta\bigl(c_n(U_n,V_n),c_m(U_m,V_m)\bigr)\right|
 =|c_n|\,|c_m|\,
   \left|\Delta\bigl((U_n,V_n),(U_m,V_m)\bigr)\right|.
```
In particular $`c_nc_m`$ divides the scaled determinant. Hence a local divisor supplied only by the two integer scalar factors is paid for by exactly the same factor in the Archimedean determinant height.*

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* All three identities are routine expansions in $`\mathbb{Z}`$ or $`\mathbb{R}`$; the divisibility statement uses the primitive determinant as its witness. ◻

Informally, Theorem <a href="#res:content" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:content">4</a> says that multiplying specialised integer rows by scalar factors moves the local gain and the Archimedean cost by exactly the same amount. Within an argument whose only extra divisor is integer scalar content, primitive normalisation therefore loses no net gain. This says nothing about polynomial factors before specialisation, cross-row common factors, determinant-specific arithmetic, or additive combinations.

<div id="ex:content" class="example">

**Example 5**. Take $`(U_n,V_n)=(1,2)`$ and $`(U_m,V_m)=(3,5)`$, so that $`\Delta=1\cdot5-3\cdot2=-1`$. Multiplying the first row by $`c_n=6`$ and the second by $`c_m=10`$ gives the rows $`(6,12)`$ and $`(30,50)`$, whose determinant is $`6\cdot50-30\cdot12=-60`$. That determinant is now divisible by $`60`$, which looks like a local gain of $`60`$; and its absolute value has risen from $`1`$ to $`60`$, which is a cost of exactly the same size.

Lean checks the error identity in [error scaling](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L84), the determinant identity in [content factorisation](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L94), the exact absolute-height identity in [absolute determinant scaling](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L104), and the divisor statement in [content-product divisibility](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L116). The elimination identity is the checked [exterior determinant identity](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L124).

The key point is that the two scalings are the same scaling. Each identity on its own is a one-line expansion, and the interest of the theorem is not in any one of them. Taken together they say that the factor $`c_nc_m`$ which a rescaling introduces into the determinant reappears undiminished, as $`|c_n|\,|c_m|`$, in the absolute value of that determinant. The third identity is displayed with absolute values for exactly that reason: it is what makes the statement one about the Archimedean height and not about divisibility alone. Whatever $`c_n`$ and $`c_m`$ are, a rescaling therefore leaves the balance between the local divisor and that height where it was.

The theorem does not construct primitive Padé rows, estimate their remainders, or prove that their exterior determinant is nonzero. It removes one source of apparent gain: multiplying a useful row by a large common integer cannot improve the local-to-Archimedean balance. Within a construction whose proposed gain comes only from those integer scalars, the rows may be primitive-normalised without a net loss. This does not say that every candidate family must use such a normalisation or that every proof needs separate $`2`$-adic and $`3`$-adic gain. The theorem quantifies over arbitrary integer pairs, so it applies whenever a construction has reached that specialised-row stage.

<a id="sec:endpoints"></a>

# Endpoint residues at $`(3,2)`$ and the four-jet kernel

Zudilin’s treatment of $`q`$-harmonic series \[zudilin2004\] builds linear forms of the shape used in Section <a href="#sec:primitive" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:primitive">3</a> out of Heine’s basic transform. The generic endpoint and jet lemmas below concern arbitrary integral coefficient pairs of this shape; they do not construct or instantiate Zudilin’s actual polynomial family. Each lemma uses no property beyond integrality and quantifies over arbitrary elements of $`\mathbb{Z}[X]`$. The exception is Theorem <a href="#res:scalar" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:scalar">17</a> at the end of the section, which concerns the scalar parameters of Zudilin’s cone rather than the coefficient polynomials.

Substituting $`X=3/2`$ into an integer polynomial produces a rational number, and multiplying by a power of $`2`$ clears its denominator. The following evaluation records that cleared numerator, so that all the arithmetic below stays inside $`\mathbb{Z}`$. For $`P(X)=\sum_i p_iX^i\in\mathbb{Z}[X]`$ and a declared width $`W\ge0`$, put
``` math
H_W(P)=\sum_{i=0}^{W}p_i\,3^i2^{W-i}.
```
This is the [homogeneous endpoint evaluation](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L98). It is homogeneous in the sense that $`X^{i}`$ is replaced by $`3^{i}2^{W-i}`$, so the numerator and the denominator of the base are carried symmetrically. When $`W\ge\deg P`$ it is exactly the cleared numerator, since
``` math
\sum_{i=0}^{W}p_i\,3^i2^{W-i}=2^{W}\sum_{i=0}^{W}p_i\left(\tfrac32\right)^{i}
 =2^{W}P\!\left(\tfrac32\right).
```

<div id="res:endpoints" class="theorem">

**Theorem 6** (endpoint residues). *Let $`P=\sum_ip_iX^i\in\mathbb{Z}[X]`$ and let $`W\ge0`$. Then
``` math
H_W(P)\equiv p_0\,2^W\pmod 3,\qquad
 H_W(P)\equiv p_W\,3^W\pmod 2.
```
Consequently a unit constant coefficient prevents divisibility by $`3`$, and a unit coefficient at the declared width $`W`$ prevents divisibility by $`2`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Modulo $`3`$, every summand with $`i>0`$ vanishes; modulo $`2`$, every summand with $`i<W`$ vanishes. The remaining powers are units in the corresponding residue fields. ◻

</div>

Since $`2^{W}`$ is invertible modulo $`3`$ and $`3^{W}`$ is invertible modulo $`2`$, the two congruences say more than the stated consequence: divisibility of $`H_W(P)`$ by $`3`$ is decided by $`p_0`$ alone, and divisibility by $`2`$ by $`p_W`$ alone. The rest of the coefficient vector is invisible to both primes. The coefficient $`p_W`$ is the top coefficient of $`P`$ exactly when $`\deg P=W`$, and is zero when $`\deg P<W`$; the identity $`H_W(P)=2^{W}P(3/2)`$ likewise holds only for $`\deg P\le W`$.

<div id="ex:endpoints" class="example">

**Example 7**. Take $`W=2`$. The three polynomials below differ only at an endpoint.

<div class="center">

| $`P`$      | $`H_2(P)`$                     | $`3\mid H_2(P)`$ | $`2\mid H_2(P)`$ |

| $`X^2+3`$  | $`3\cdot4+0\cdot6+1\cdot9=21`$ |       yes        |        no        |

</div>

The first has both endpoints equal to $`1`$ and its evaluation, $`13`$, is divisible by neither prime; as a check, $`2^{2}\bigl((3/2)^2+1\bigr)=13`$. The second and third show that each hypothesis is used: spoiling the constant endpoint admits $`3`$, and spoiling the top endpoint admits $`2`$.

The congruences are the [bottom-endpoint identity](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L203) and [top-endpoint identity](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L320); the unit consequences are the [constant-endpoint obstruction](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L338) and [top-endpoint obstruction](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L356).

The proof is two lines, but the shape of the statement is not incidental. The difficulty lies in the fact that the specialisation sees a different endpoint at each of the two primes: modulo $`3`$ only the constant coefficient survives, and modulo $`2`$ only the top one does. The two exclusions are therefore conditions at opposite ends of the coefficient vector, and the statement below imposes one at each end, on the two entries of a single coefficient pair.

<div id="res:commonmult" class="proposition">

**Proposition 8** (common divisor). *Let $`U,V\in\mathbb{Z}[X]`$ and let $`W\ge0`$. If $`U`$ has unit top endpoint, $`V`$ has unit constant endpoint, and an integer $`c`$ divides both $`H_W(U)`$ and $`H_W(V)`$, then
``` math
2\nmid c\qquad\text{and}\qquad 3\nmid c.

This is the checked [common-divisor exclusion](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L398). The proposition does not say that the two evaluations are coprime; it says that whatever they share misses both of the primes that matter at $`3/2`$.

**Example 9**. Take $`W=2`$, $`U=X^2+3`$ and $`V=5X^2+1`$. The top endpoint of $`U`$ and the constant endpoint of $`V`$ are both $`1`$, and
``` math
H_2(U)=3\cdot4+1\cdot9=21,\qquad H_2(V)=1\cdot4+5\cdot9=49 .

One further consequence of Theorem <a href="#res:endpoints" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:endpoints">6</a> is worth stating, because it bears on the most natural way one might hope to import an existing denominator reduction. Write $`\Phi_m`$ for the $`m`$th cyclotomic polynomial and, for coprime $`a>b\ge1`$, put $`\Phi_m(a,b)=b^{\varphi(m)}\Phi_m(a/b)`$ for its homogenisation at the declared width $`\varphi(m)=\deg\Phi_m`$.

The kernel-checked declaration [](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L302) proves Proposition <a href="#res:cyclounit" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:cyclounit">11</a> in the same homogeneous-evaluation representation. It checks Proposition 3.6 under the displayed coprimality assumptions; it does not certify the later analytic deductions or Proposition 8.6.

The methods that reduce denominators at integer bases—the factorial-coset quotients of Rhin and Viola \[rhinviola1996\] and the order-twelve group and cyclotomic divisor of Zudilin \[zudilin2004\]—produce their gain as cyclotomic or factorial factors of the coefficient polynomials. Proposition <a href="#res:cyclounit" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:cyclounit">11</a> says that transporting such a factor through the homogenisation at $`(3,2)`$ contributes no power of $`2`$ and no power of $`3`$, whatever its size. This does not make such factors useless: a large odd divisor still reduces Archimedean height, and that is a different account of the same product formula. It does say that the $`2`$- and $`3`$-primary gain the architecture of Section <a href="#sec:open" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:open">9</a> requires must come from somewhere other than an imported cyclotomic factor. The exclusions therefore reflect the architecture itself, beyond the local behaviour of the two primes involved.

Both ingredients are Lean-checked; the combination is an ordinary deduction and is not separately formalised. The corollary excludes two ways of producing the targeted gain. It does not show that a gain of that kind is necessary for a proof by linear forms at $`3/2`$.

Corollary <a href="#res:nomult" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:nomult">10</a> excludes the two multiplicative mechanisms above, and one candidate pursued in the rest of this section is additive: rather than multiplying one row by a scalar, take an integer combination of several rows and ask that the combination be divisible where the individual rows are not. The endpoint congruences are the first case of a divisibility condition that can be imposed to any depth, and it is that condition, read additively, which is counted below.

We first raise the two congruences to prime powers. Fix depths $`R,S\ge0`$. For $`P\in\mathbb{Z}[X]`$ the *bottom jet* $`J_{3,R}(P)`$ is the residue of $`H_W(P)`$ modulo $`3^R`$, and the *top jet* $`J_{2,S}(P)`$ is its residue modulo $`2^S`$; Theorem <a href="#res:endpoints" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:endpoints">6</a> computes them at $`R=S=1`$. Their vanishing is exactly the requested divisibility:
``` math
J_{3,R}(P)=0\iff 3^R\mid H_W(P),\qquad
 J_{2,S}(P)=0\iff 2^S\mid H_W(P).
```
These are the checked [bottom-jet divisibility criterion](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L191) and [top-jet divisibility criterion](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L197).

The *four-jet signature* of a coefficient pair $`(U,V)`$ is then the quadruple
``` math
\bigl(J_{3,R}(U),J_{3,R}(V),J_{2,S}(U),J_{2,S}(V)\bigr)
 \in(\mathbb{Z}/3^R\mathbb{Z})^2\times(\mathbb{Z}/2^S\mathbb{Z})^2 ,
```
two residues for each of the two primes, one from each entry of the pair. By the displayed criteria it vanishes exactly when $`3^R`$ divides both specialised entries and $`2^S`$ divides both.

For this candidate architecture, this turns the targeted local divisor into an additive congruence-kernel problem: what is sought is no longer a common divisor of the two evaluations, but a vector of small integer coefficients on which four residues vanish at once. Since $`H_W`$ is linear in the coefficients of $`P`$, the four-jet signature of a combination is the corresponding combination of signatures, which is what makes the following count possible.

<div id="res:jetkernel" class="theorem">

Counting alone does not ensure that the two selectors produce different analytic remainders. The exact missing step is a bounded-fibre estimate.

<div id="res:boundedfibre" class="theorem">

**Theorem 14** (bounded-fibre escape). *Let $`A`$ and $`B`$ be finite sets, let $`f:A\to B`$, and let $`g:A\to C`$ be any map into a set $`C`$. Suppose every fibre of $`g`$ has at most $`k`$ elements. If
``` math
|B|k<|A|,
```
then there exist distinct $`x,y\in A`$ such that
``` math
f(x)=f(y)\qquad\hbox{and}\qquad g(x)\ne g(y).
```
Thus, with $`f`$ the four-jet sum and $`g`$ the analytic remainder, a uniform remainder-multiplicity bound converts surplus selector entropy into a four-jet collision outside the remainder nullspace.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* If every pair in a common $`f`$-fibre also had the same $`g`$-value, each $`f`$-fibre would lie in one $`g`$-fibre and hence have size at most $`k`$. Summing over the at most $`|B|`$ fibres of $`f`$ would give $`|A|\le |B|k`$, contrary to the hypothesis. ◻

This finite escape principle is [checked here](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/AdelicHeightBridge.lean#L311).

<div id="res:plucker-collapse" class="theorem">

**Theorem 15** (Bézout–Plücker tail collapse). *Let $`R_0`$ be a commutative ring and let $`w_n=(A_n,B_n)\in R_0^2`$. Suppose that every $`B_n`$ is a unit and every adjacent minor vanishes:
``` math
A_nB_{n+1}-B_nA_{n+1}=0\qquad(n\ge0).
```
Then every pairwise minor $`A_iB_j-B_iA_j`$ vanishes. In particular, take $`R_0=\mathbb{Z}/(2^S3^R)\mathbb{Z}`$ with $`R>0`$. If $`S+2R\le k`$, there are two distinct binary selectors $`s,t\in\{0,1\}^{k}`$ such that
``` math
\sum_{i<k}s_iw_i=\sum_{i<k}t_iw_i.
```
Thus the sufficient width is $`S+2R`$, rather than the ambient two-coordinate width $`2S+4R`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* A unit second coordinate makes each row a unimodular anchor. Vanishing of the next minor therefore writes the next row as a scalar multiple of the current one; induction places the entire tail on the line through $`w_0`$ and proves the pairwise-minor assertion. A determinant-one Bézout shear sends $`w_0`$ to $`(1,0)`$, so all selector sums have only one free residue coordinate and occupy at most $`2^S3^R`$ values. Finally
``` math
2^S3^R<2^S4^R=2^{S+2R}\le2^k,
```
and pigeonhole gives the two selectors. ◻

This conditional theorem is stronger than the ambient four-jet count only after its minor-vanishing hypothesis has been established. No such all-tail hypothesis is proved here for an actual $`q`$-Apéry or Zudilin family, and the theorem says nothing about whether the resulting selector difference has nonzero analytic remainder.

**Boundary.** Corollary <a href="#res:rankfortyone" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:rankfortyone">13</a> is a sharp finite kernel statement at $`T=1`$, not an analytic nonvanishing theorem. Theorem <a href="#res:boundedfibre" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:boundedfibre">14</a> identifies the precise extra input needed to escape the nullspace, but this paper does not prove a multiplicity bound for the actual $`q`$-Apéry or Zudilin remainder family.

The target count is the checked [four-jet target cardinality](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L131); the abstract collision is the checked [four-jet pigeonhole kernel](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L142), and the linear sufficient condition is the checked [rank–depth collision threshold](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L161). The count is a routine pigeonhole; the reformulation above is what makes it relevant. Pigeonhole cancellation itself requires no independence. Additional information about the input family is needed to ensure that the resulting nonzero selector difference has a nonzero combined polynomial pair and analytic remainder. None of the statements proved here supplies such a family or proves either nonvanishing conclusion.

<div id="ex:jetcount" class="example">

**Example 16**. At depths $`R=S=1`$ the four-jet target is $`(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})^2\times(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^2`$, of cardinality $`9\cdot4=36`$, and the threshold reads $`M\ge4\cdot1+2\cdot1=6`$. With six pairs there are $`2^{6}=64`$ binary selectors against $`36`$ targets, so two of them collide and their difference is a vector in $`\{-1,0,1\}^{6}`$, not identically zero, killing all four jets.

</div>

Informally, the theorem says only this: once there are at least $`4R+2S`$ pairs and the bottom depth $`R`$ is positive, some coefficient vector in $`\{-1,0,1\}^M`$, not identically zero, kills all four jets of the corresponding combination. It does not say that the combination is nonzero as a pair of polynomials, and it does not say that its remainder is nonzero. Those are the two obligations Problem <a href="#prob:kernel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prob:kernel">29</a> carries.

One further exclusion is recorded here. It concerns the scalar parameters of Zudilin’s cone rather than the coefficient polynomials.

<div id="res:scalar" class="theorem">

**Theorem 17** (scalar margin no-go). *Let $`C_1>0`$. If $`C_0\le0`$ or $`2C_0\le C_1`$, then
``` math
C_0\log 3-C_1\log 2<0.
```
In the positive branch $`C_0>0`$ and $`2C_0\le C_1`$, the stronger estimate is
``` math
C_0\log3-C_1\log2< -\frac{17}{41}C_0\log2.
```*

</div>

Written multiplicatively, the conclusion is $`3^{C_0}<2^{C_1}`$. The inequality is immediate from $`\log3<2\log2`$ and $`C_1>0`$, and is the checked [three-halves scalar margin](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinConeArithmetic.lean#L428). The positive-branch deficit is the checked [$`17/41`$ margin](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/AdelicHeightBridge.lean#L242). The interest is in the fence around it. The primary Zudilin theorem \[zudilin2004, Theorem 1, p. 154; Sec. 5, pp. 161–162\] supplies an integer-base irrationality-exponent estimate on its parameter cone, and the elementary inequality $`\mu\ge2`$ then forces $`2C_0\le C_1`$ whenever $`C_0>0`$; Lean checks that implication separately. The primary theorem assumes an integer base $`p=1/q`$. It does not state a rational $`p=3/2`$ theorem, so the all-scale coefficient construction and rational specialisation remain external to the checked result, which is the scalar parameter margin alone.

# Failure of coordinatewise clearing at $`3/2`$

This section and the next return to the elementary route and record what the residue $`s^{n}`$ costs there. We first isolate the arithmetic that the clearing scheme leaves behind, in a form that does not mention the series. The point of doing so is that the clearing argument asks for two things at once, that a power of the numerator divide what has been accumulated and that what survives be small, and these are easier to play off against each other once the series has been discarded and only six natural numbers remain.

<div id="def:corridor" class="definition">

**Definition 18** (coordinatewise corridor). Let $`a,b,N,K,Q,D`$ be natural numbers. Say that $`(a,b,N,K,Q,D)`$ is a *coordinatewise corridor* when
``` math
a>0,\qquad Q>0,\qquad D>0,\qquad D\le N+K,\qquad
 a^{K}\mid QD,\qquad Q\,b^{\,N+K+1}<a^{\,K+1}.
```

</div>

The reading is: $`a`$ and $`b`$ are the numerator and denominator of the base, playing the roles of $`r`$ and $`s`$ in the introduction, so that $`(a,b)=(3,2)`$ is the case of interest; $`N`$ is the shift, $`K`$ is the width of the cleared window, $`Q`$ is the accumulated clearing factor, and $`D`$ is the final coefficient being cleared. The bound $`D\le N+K`$ is the only property of the coefficient used; for the divisor-counting coefficient it holds because $`\tau(n)\le n`$. The divisibility $`a^{K}\mid QD`$ is the requirement that clearing succeeded coordinatewise, and the last inequality is the tail estimate that makes the trapped integer smaller than $`1`$. The name records the shape of the constraint: the divisibility bounds $`a^{K}`$ from above by $`Q(N+K)`$, the tail estimate bounds $`a^{K+1}`$ from below by $`Q\,b^{\,N+K+1}`$, and admissible parameters must fit in the band between them. The definition is the [corridor predicate](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L113).

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* A routine divisibility computation. Since $`QD>0`$ and $`a^{K}\mid QD`$, we have $`a^{K}\le QD`$, and $`D\le N+K`$ gives $`a^{K}\le Q(N+K)`$. Hence
``` math
Q\,b^{\,N+K+1}<a^{\,K+1}=a^{K}\cdot a\le Q(N+K)\cdot a,

The inequality of Theorem <a href="#res:corridorbound" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:corridorbound">19</a> is where the integer and rational cases part. At $`b=1`$ it reads $`1<a(N+K)`$, which holds for every $`a\ge2`$ and every nonempty window; this necessary inequality imposes no obstruction. The other corridor hypotheses remain in force. At $`b\ge2`$ the left side is exponential in $`N+K`$ and the right side is linear, so the corridor can survive only for small $`N+K`$. At $`(a,b)=(3,2)`$ the crossing has already happened at the smallest admissible window.

**Example 20**. Take the smallest window, $`N=K=1`$, and numerator $`a=3`$.

The tail estimate becomes $`Q\cdot2^{3}<3^{2}`$, which forces $`Q=1`$; the divisibility then reads $`3\mid D`$, and the only candidates are $`D=1`$ and $`D=2`$, neither divisible by $`3`$.

# The cleared-tail recurrence and the size of the forcing term

Theorem <a href="#res:nocorridor" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:nocorridor">22</a> says that one scheme fails. This section identifies the quantity responsible, as an exact recurrence.

Let $`r,s,B,F`$ be rationals with $`r\ne0`$ and let $`c:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{Q}`$ be arbitrary. Define the prefix and the cleared tail state by
``` math
P_N=\sum_{m=0}^{N-1}\frac{c(m+1)\,s^{\,m+1}}{r^{\,m+1}},
 \qquad
 U_N=B\,r^{N}\bigl(F-P_N\bigr).
\tag{$\ast$}\label{eq:tailstate}
```
Thus $`P_N`$ is the partial sum of $`\sum_{n\ge1}c(n)(s/r)^{n}`$ through level $`N`$, and $`U_N`$ is the tail of a putative value $`F`$ after that level, scaled by $`Br^{N}`$. These are the [rational-base prefix](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L168) and the [cleared tail state](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L181).

<div id="res:tailrec" class="theorem">

**Theorem 23** (cleared-tail recurrence). *Let $`r,s,B,F\in\mathbb{Q}`$ with $`r\ne0`$, let $`c:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{Q}`$, and let $`P_N`$ and $`U_N`$ be as in <a href="#eq:tailstate" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:tailstate">[eq:tailstate]</a>. Then for every $`N`$,

The recurrence has a linear part $`rU_N`$ and a forcing term $`Bc(N+1)s^{N+1}`$, the inhomogeneous term the state receives at each step. The direct-clearing route studied here works only if the state remains in a bounded window, and the forcing term is what that window must absorb. Its size is what separates the two denominator regimes.

At $`s=1`$ the forcing term is $`Bc(N+1)`$, so it grows only as fast as the coefficient; for the divisor function that is $`O(N^{\varepsilon})`$ for every $`\varepsilon>0`$, and a bounded-state argument has room. At $`s\ge2`$ the same term is at least $`2^{N+1}`$ whenever the coefficient is nonzero.

<div id="ex:forcing" class="example">

**Example 25**. Take $`B=1`$, $`c=\tau`$ and $`N=9`$, so that the coefficient is $`\tau(10)=4`$. At $`s=1`$ the forcing term is $`4`$. At $`s=2`$ it is $`4\cdot2^{10}=4096`$, and part (1) of Theorem <a href="#res:forcing" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:forcing">24</a> already guarantees at least $`2^{10}=1024`$ without knowing the coefficient at all.

</div>

This is an exact lower bound on one quantity, and it is all that is proved. It is not a proof that no bounded-state argument exists at $`s\ge2`$; the theorem that one particular scheme fails is Theorem <a href="#res:nocorridor" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:nocorridor">22</a>, and the bound here records the size of the term that scheme would have to absorb.

# The height criterion at $`7/2`$

In 1994 Bundschuh and Väänänen proved an irrationality criterion for a family of rational bases cut out by a height condition \[bv1994, Theorem 2, p. 177; hypotheses pp. 175–176\]. We keep their notation: $`q`$ is the base, and $`\alpha`$ and $`\lambda`$ are the parameters of the criterion. In its special case $`\alpha=-1`$, the printed hypothesis is
``` math
\lambda<\left(\frac12+\frac1{\pi^2}\right)^{-1}.
```
At $`q=7/2`$ the Archimedean parameter is $`\lambda=\log 7/\log(7/2)`$. The criterion therefore applies once the following strict inequality is checked.

<div id="res:sevenhalves" class="theorem">

**Theorem 26** (the $`7/2`$ height condition).
*``` math
\frac{\log 7}{\log(7/2)}

 \left(\frac12+\frac1{\pi^2}\right)^{-1}.
```*

</div>

Numerically the two sides are $`1.5533\ldots`$ and $`1.6630\ldots`$, so the condition holds with a margin of about $`0.11`$. The Lean proof factors the estimate through the explicit [height-region predicate](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L44) and the [integer certificate](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L32) $`2^{18}<7^7`$, the resulting [logarithmic ratio bound](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L48) $`\log2/\log7<7/18`$, the [$`\pi`$-bound](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L64) $`1/\pi^2<1/9`$, and the [strict margin](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L73)
``` math
\frac{\log2}{\log7}<\frac12-\frac1{\pi^2}.

The [final height inequality](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalBaseLambert.lean#L83) then rewrites $`\log(7/2)=\log7-\log2`$ and closes the displayed condition.

This formalises the complete elementary parameter check at $`q=7/2`$; it does not formalise Bundschuh and Väänänen’s analytic irrationality theorem, whose proof occupies pp. 189–193 of the source. The conclusion that $`F(7/2)`$ is irrational is consequently cited from that theorem, not claimed as a Lean theorem here.

The criterion does not cover $`3/2`$, and the results of Sections <a href="#sec:corridor" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:corridor">5</a> and <a href="#sec:tail" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:tail">6</a> give no evidence either way about whether $`F(3/2)`$ is irrational.

## The $`81/200`$ logarithmic region

Consider the rational-height region
``` math
\frac{\log b}{\log a}<\frac{81}{200}
 \qquad(a>b>0).
```
No bibliographic source for an analytic irrationality theorem at this cutoff is asserted here. The Lean module instead treats the displayed inequality as a definition and proves elementary memberships and exclusions. In particular,
``` math
\frac25
 <\frac{\log4}{\log31}
 <\frac{81}{200}
 <\frac{\log2}{\log3}.
```
The first two comparisons come respectively from $`31^2<4^5`$ and $`4^{200}<31^{81}`$; the last comes from $`3^{81}<2^{200}`$. The lower bound is the checked theorem [two-fifths lower bound](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinHeightRegion.lean#L65). Consequently $`31/4`$, and every positive power $`(31/4)^r`$, lies in the enlarged region ([checked](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinHeightRegion.lean#L45), [power family](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinHeightRegion.lean#L59)). The same base lies strictly outside the earlier Bundschuh–Väänänen region ([checked](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinHeightRegion.lean#L91)), so the $`81/200`$ inequality defines a strict set-theoretic enlargement of the earlier recorded logarithmic region. Membership alone supplies no irrationality theorem for $`31/4`$.

It still does not approach $`3/2`$. The exact comparison
``` math
3^{81}<2^{200}
 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
 \frac{81}{200}<\frac{\log2}{\log3}
```
is Lean-checked, as is the conclusion that $`3/2`$ belongs to neither height region ([boundary](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinHeightRegion.lean#L105), [exclusion](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/ZudilinHeightRegion.lean#L122)). Thus $`81/200`$ is the larger of the two explicitly defined cutoffs used below, while a cutoff that includes $`3/2`$ must be strictly larger than $`\log2/\log3\approx0.6309`$.

# Denominator exponents for a homogenised Padé construction

A second external route builds the linear forms of Section <a href="#sec:primitive" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:primitive">3</a> by Padé approximation. Such a construction produces its coefficients as sums of rational summands, and to obtain integer rows one multiplies through by a single common denominator. The bookkeeping obligation is then to check that no summand needs a larger denominator than the one proposed, which is a comparison between the exponents alone. This section does that comparison, and only that.

No source construction is named here for the exponent expressions below, and they are checked as displayed polynomial identities rather than derived. Giving them Padé-theoretic force would additionally require deriving the expressions from a stated homogenised coefficient formula, proving integrality of the coefficients after multiplication by the proposed common denominator, and establishing nonvanishing and decay of the associated remainder. None of those three is claimed here.

For a homogenised construction over integer parameters the proposed common denominator exponent is $`E_n=(3n^{2}-n)/2`$. Since only doubled exponents occur below, every statement lives over $`\mathbb{Z}`$ and no parity bookkeeping is needed; we write $`\widetilde{E}_n=2E_n=3n^{2}-n`$.

<div id="res:pade" class="proposition">

**Proposition 27** (summand bound and exact gap). *Let $`\widetilde{E}_n=3n^{2}-n`$ and put
``` math
\widetilde{P}(n,k)=2\bigl(k(n-k)+nk\bigr)+k(k-1),
```
``` math
\widetilde{Q}(n,m)=2(n^{2}-n)+j^{2}+2jm+j-m^{2}+3m,
 \qquad j=n-m-1 .
```
Then, for integers $`n,k,m`$:*

1.  *if $`0\le k\le n`$, then $`\widetilde{P}(n,k)\le\widetilde{E}_n`$, and the gap factors as $`\widetilde{E}_n-\widetilde{P}(n,k)=(n-k)(3n-k-1)`$;*

2.  *$`\widetilde{E}_n-\widetilde{Q}(n,m)=2\bigl(n+m(m-1)\bigr)`$ identically;*

3.  *if $`n\ge0`$ and $`m\ge1`$, then $`\widetilde{Q}(n,m)\le\widetilde{E}_n`$.*

</div>

Part (1) is the [summand exponent bound](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L30), part (2) the [exact gap identity](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L52), and part (3) the [maximal exponent bound](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/RationalPadeArithmetic.lean#L60). The gap in (2) is an identity in $`\mathbb{Z}[n,m]`$, so (3) follows from $`m(m-1)\ge0`$ and $`n\ge0`$; the hypothesis $`m\ge1`$ names the range in which the corresponding summand does not vanish, and it is not the sharpest hypothesis under which the inequality holds.

<div id="ex:pade" class="example">

**Example 28**. At $`n=2`$ the proposed doubled exponent is $`\widetilde{E}_2=10`$, and $`\widetilde{P}(2,k)`$ takes the values $`0,6,10`$ at $`k=0,1,2`$. The three gaps are $`10,4,0`$, matching the factorisation $`(2-k)(5-k)`$ of part (1); the summand at $`k=2`$ is the one that saturates the proposed denominator. For part (2), at $`m=1`$ we have $`j=0`$ and $`\widetilde{Q}(2,1)=6`$, with gap $`4=2\bigl(2+1\cdot0\bigr)`$.

</div>

These are routine inequalities between polynomials in the exponents. They establish that the proposed exponent $`\widetilde{E}_n`$ dominates the two displayed summand exponent expressions, and nothing further. Positivity of the remainder, its rate of decay, and the comparison of that rate against the denominator height are the analytic obligations, and none of them is treated here, so nothing in this section is an irrationality measure.

# Complements and further questions

Problem #1049 remains open. Theorem <a href="#res:jetkernel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:jetkernel">12</a> suggests the following precise sufficient subproblem for one common-width additive architecture. It is not asserted to be necessary for every proof of irrationality.

<div id="prob:kernel" class="problem">

**Problem 29** (common-width simultaneous endpoint-jet construction). Exhibit an integer constant $`C\ge1`$ and, for every sufficiently large positive integer $`n`$, positive integers $`W_n,R_n,S_n,M_n`$ such that
``` math
n^2\le W_n,R_n,S_n\le Cn^2,
 \qquad 4R_n+2S_n\le M_n\le Cn^2,
```
together with polynomial pairs $`(U_{n,j},V_{n,j})\in\mathbb{Z}[X]^2`$ for $`0\le j<M_n`$, each of degree at most the common declared width $`W_n`$, whose specialised integer rows are primitive:
``` math
\gcd\!\bigl(H_{W_n}(U_{n,j}),H_{W_n}(V_{n,j})\bigr)=1.
```
Find a nonzero vector $`\lambda^{(n)}\in\{-1,0,1\}^{M_n}`$ for which, on putting
``` math
U_n=\sum_{j<M_n}\lambda^{(n)}_jU_{n,j},
 \qquad V_n=\sum_{j<M_n}\lambda^{(n)}_jV_{n,j},
```
the pair $`(U_n,V_n)`$ is not $`(0,0)`$, all four common-width jets vanish,
``` math
J_{3,R_n}(U_n)=J_{3,R_n}(V_n)=0,
 \qquad J_{2,S_n}(U_n)=J_{2,S_n}(V_n)=0,
```
where every jet in this display is formed using the declared width $`W_n`$, and the resulting divided integer linear form
``` math
A_n=\frac{H_{W_n}(U_n)}{3^{R_n}2^{S_n}},
 \qquad
 B_n=\frac{H_{W_n}(V_n)}{3^{R_n}2^{S_n}},
 \qquad
 \rho_n=A_nF(3/2)-B_n
```
satisfies the explicit analytic condition
``` math
0<|\rho_n|<\frac1n.
```

</div>

The jet equations make $`A_n,B_n`$ integers. A solution would prove irrationality: if $`F(3/2)=a/b`$ in lowest terms, every nonzero $`\rho_n`$ has absolute value at least $`1/b`$, contradicting the displayed bound for $`n>b`$. Theorem <a href="#res:jetkernel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:jetkernel">12</a> supplies only a nonzero signed relation with the four jet equations once the pairs and size inequality are present; it does not supply primitive input rows, a nonzero combined polynomial pair, or the nonvanishing and decay of $`\rho_n`$.

Integer rescaling and a common divisor of the two specialised evaluations are the two mechanisms excluded by Corollary <a href="#res:nomult" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:nomult">10</a>. Polynomial factors before specialisation, cross-row or determinant-specific arithmetic, cyclotomic factors, other additive constructions, and entirely different architectures remain outside that corollary and are not decided either way.

The remaining linear-form argument therefore has two independent gates: first find a four-jet collision that does not collapse algebraically or analytically; only then ask whether its divisibility and decay beat its height. We state those gates separately below.

<a id="exact-kernel-escape"></a>

## Exact kernel escape

Fix, for each $`n`$, a declared width $`W_n`$ and a specified family
``` math
(U_{n,j},V_{n,j},\mathcal R_{n,j})_{j<M_n},
```
where $`U_{n,j},V_{n,j}\in\mathbb{Z}[X]`$ and $`\mathcal R_{n,j}`$ is the corresponding remainder function. Normalisation must be fixed before the jet map is formed. Call the family *polynomially primitive* when the common coefficient content of the pair in $`\mathbb{Z}[X]^2`$ is divided out before specialisation; as the Terminology paragraph records, that is a different operation from primitive normalisation of a specialised integer row, which is what Problem <a href="#prob:kernel" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prob:kernel">29</a> imposes.

The specialised row content
``` math
g^{\mathrm{spec}}_{n,j}
 =\gcd\!\bigl(H_{W_n}(U_{n,j}),H_{W_n}(V_{n,j})\bigr)
```
and the content of a final additive combination are separate quantities; they are not silently divided out. If either is divided out later, both the height and the remainder below are measured after that same division. Under the unit endpoint hypotheses, $`g^{\mathrm{spec}}_{n,j}`$ is coprime to $`6`$, so such division does not manufacture or destroy the $`2`$- and $`3`$-primary jet vanishing.

For target depths $`R_n,S_n`$, let $`J_n(\lambda)`$ be the four-jet signature of the pair $`\sum_j\lambda_j(U_{n,j},V_{n,j})`$, and define
``` math
\mathcal C_n=
 \{\lambda\in\{-1,0,1\}^{M_n}\mathbin{\backslash}\{0\}:J_n(\lambda)=0\},
```
``` math
\begin{aligned}
 K_n^{\mathrm{poly}}
   &=\left\{\lambda\in\{-1,0,1\}^{M_n}:
       \sum_j\lambda_jU_{n,j}=0,\ \sum_j\lambda_jV_{n,j}=0\right\},\\
 K_n^{\mathrm{rem}}
   &=\left\{\lambda\in\{-1,0,1\}^{M_n}:
       \sum_j\lambda_j\mathcal R_{n,j}(3/2)=0\right\}.
\end{aligned}
```
The second nullspace concerns the value at $`3/2`$; an identically zero remainder function is a still stronger collapse and is automatically bad.

The exact pigeonhole condition is
``` math
2^{M_n}>3^{2R_n}2^{2S_n},
 \qquad\text{equivalently}\qquad
 M_n>2R_n\log_2 3+2S_n.
\tag{8.1}\label{eq:exact-jet-threshold}
```
Thus the least admissible integer rank is
``` math
M_{\min}(R,S)=
 \left\lfloor2R\log_2 3+2S\right\rfloor+1.
```
The checked condition $`M\ge4R+2S`$ for $`R>0`$ is a convenient sufficient corollary, not the exact threshold. Moreover, with $`N=2^{M_n}`$ and $`Q=3^{2R_n}2^{2S_n}`$, convexity of the fibre sizes gives at least
``` math
\frac12\left(\frac{N^2}{Q}-N\right)
\tag{8.2}\label{eq:collision-count}
```
unordered equal-signature selector pairs. A normality estimate can therefore win by showing that fewer than this many collision pairs land in the two bad nullspaces.

**Problem 30** (four-jet kernel escape). For one literal polynomially primitive family satisfying <a href="#eq:exact-jet-threshold" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:exact-jet-threshold">[eq:exact-jet-threshold]</a>, prove, preferably by comparing the lower bound <a href="#eq:collision-count" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:collision-count">[eq:collision-count]</a> with the bad-pair multiplicities, that

<a id="determinant-families"></a>

## Determinant families

An exploratory calculation suggests a contiguous $`a_0`$-shift determinant at $`r_n=13n+2`$, after apparent failure of lower ranks $`r\le13n+1`$. These computations are not Lean theorems. More importantly, no literal definition of the matrix $`A_{n,r}`$ is given here, so writing merely “$`\det A_{n,13n+2}\ne0`$” would not yet be a public mathematical question.

<div class="problem">

**Problem 31** (the first saturated determinant). Give the entrywise formula for the contiguous $`a_0`$-shift matrix $`A_{n,r}`$, the exact relation $`M_n=M(n,r)`$ between its size and the number of coefficient pairs, and the declared width $`W_n`$. Then determine whether
``` math
\det A_{n,13n+2}\ne0
```
for every sufficiently large $`n`$. At the first computable scales, report the rank, determinant, coefficient-pair contents, specialised row contents, four endpoint jets, and the first nonzero remainder coefficient. A negative answer must identify a systematic rank relation or the first exact failing $`n`$.

</div>

This formulation makes the matrix definition part of the problem statement rather than relying on undeclared notation.

<div class="problem">

**Problem 32** (minimal non-$`a_0`$ deformation). If the saturated contiguous family collapses, enlarge it by exactly one $`a_1`$-shift while retaining the same source cone and widths. Does this one-direction extension increase the polynomial-pair rank and produce a collision outside $`K_n^{\mathrm{poly}}\cup K_n^{\mathrm{rem}}`$? If every such one-shift extension collapses, prove that class-wide obstruction before adding a second new direction.

</div>

This is the smallest specified deformation beyond the contiguous family; it replaces the unbounded request for a “genuinely independent deformation.”

<a id="asymptotic-adequacy-after-kernel-escape"></a>

## Asymptotic adequacy after kernel escape

Suppose a good collision has been found. Let $`D_n=3^{R_n}2^{S_n}`$ be the certified local divisor (or replace it by the exact determinant-specific divisor), let $`H_n`$ be the coefficient or exterior height after precisely the normalisation just declared, and let $`L_n\ne0`$ be the resulting analytic form or exterior remainder.

<div class="problem">

**Problem 33** (negative normalised product-formula margin). Prove the explicit estimate
``` math
\limsup_{n\to\infty}
 \frac{\log H_n+\log|L_n|-R_n\log3-S_n\log2}{n^2}<0.
\tag{8.3}\label{eq:negative-margin}
```
Every denominator, row content and final-combination content must already be included in $`H_n`$ and $`L_n`$.

</div>

Nonvanishing alone does not address <a href="#eq:negative-margin" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:negative-margin">[eq:negative-margin]</a>. Conversely, excellent formal decay is irrelevant if every jet collision lies in a bad nullspace. The exploratory adjacent-exterior calculation leaves a positive normalised exponent of about $`110.850\,n^2`$; this is not a checked theorem. Any proposed improvement must remove this explicit deficit; extra divisibility alone is insufficient.

<a id="one-exact-alternative-criterion-test"></a>

## One exact alternative-criterion test

A separate possible method is Mahler’s method. Its first applicability test has an exact negative answer, which we record here; an earlier version of this note left it open.

<div id="res:nomahler" class="proposition">

**Proposition 34** (no finite simultaneous $`2/3`$-system). *Let
``` math
\mathcal L(z)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{z^n}{1-z^n}.
```
There is no finite-dimensional $`\mathbb{Q}(z)`$-vector space that contains $`\mathcal L`$ and is stable under both $`z\mapsto z^2`$ and $`z\mapsto z^3`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Suppose $`V`$ were such a space, of dimension $`d`$. Stability under $`z\mapsto z^2`$ places the $`d+1`$ elements $`\mathcal L(z),\mathcal L(z^2),\dots,\mathcal
L(z^{2^{d}})`$ in $`V`$, so they are linearly dependent over $`\mathbb{Q}(z)`$; clearing denominators gives polynomials $`P_0,\dots,P_d`$, not all zero, with $`\sum_{i=0}^{d}P_i(z)\mathcal L(z^{2^i})=0`$. Thus $`\mathcal L`$ is $`2`$-Mahler, and the same argument under $`z\mapsto z^3`$ makes it $`3`$-Mahler. Since $`2`$ and $`3`$ are multiplicatively independent, a theorem of Adamczewski and Bell \[adamczewskibell2013, Theorem 1\] then forces $`\mathcal L`$ to be a rational function. That contradicts Rivin’s periodic-coefficient corollary \[rivin2026, Cor. 6.4, p. 9\], by which $`\mathcal L`$ is not rational. ◻

</div>

The proposition uses no property of the point $`2/3`$: the obstruction is functional and appears before regularity at a particular point is considered. It closes the simultaneous route only. It says nothing about a single $`k`$-Mahler system, about $`q`$-difference or Mahler-type arguments that do not require stability under two multiplicatively independent substitutions, or about special-value theorems reached by other means. Neither ingredient is proved here; both are cited.

<a id="the-quantitative-height-limitation"></a>

## The quantitative height limitation

The module `HermitePadeNoGo` defines an explicit rectangular two-parameter exponent model. Writing $`\sigma=1+\rho+u`$, its denominator-cleared gap has the exact expansion
``` math
-\pi^2\rho^2-\pi^2\rho u-2\pi^2\rho-2\rho^2-10\rho u
 -4\rho-6u^2-8u.
```
Thus for $`\rho\ge0`$ and $`\sigma\ge1+\rho`$ the cleared gap is nonpositive, and it vanishes exactly when $`\rho=0`$ and $`\sigma=1`$ ([exact expansion](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/HermitePadeNoGo.lean#L48), [nonpositivity](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/HermitePadeNoGo.lean#L58), [equality case](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/HermitePadeNoGo.lean#L75)). Equivalently, within that model the displayed threshold never exceeds the classical one-function margin, with equality only at the classical endpoint ([bound](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/HermitePadeNoGo.lean#L103), [equality](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/bb37f2c5bfcf4e858f454c25fb3bf53fc8df2753/ErdosProblems/Erdos1049/HermitePadeNoGo.lean#L126)). This is an algebraic theorem about the four defined exponent expressions and only that explicit rectangular model. It does not construct polynomials, remainders, integrality, a determinant, or asymptotics, and it is not a method-universal no-go theorem. The separate $`81/200`$ cutoff of the preceding section satisfies
``` math
\frac{81}{200}<\frac{\log2}{\log3}.
```
Thus “improve the height theorem” has a precise numerical target.

<div class="problem">

**Problem 35** (optimal admissible height threshold). Specify a concrete class $`\mathcal A`$ of primitive, noncollapsed constructions, excluding scalar row rescaling, proportional permutation-orbit forms, pure row-content gain, and constructions governed by the rectangular exponent model above. For that class define
``` math
\theta_*=\sup_{\alpha\in\mathcal A}
   \frac{C_0(\alpha)}{C_1(\alpha)}.
```
Prove one of the following: $`\theta_*>81/200`$ by an explicit construction; an exact value for $`\theta_*`$; a converse $`\theta_*<\log2/\log3`$; or a class theorem showing that every member reduces to one of the checked scalar or rectangular no-go mechanisms.

</div>

Reaching $`3/2`$ requires a threshold strictly beyond $`\log2/\log3\approx0.6309`$; exceeding $`81/200=0.405`$ is insufficient. The unrestricted question of which rational bases give irrational values remains open and is not reduced to any one of these problems.

Each linked phrase opens its Lean declaration at the pinned source revision bb37f2c5bfcf. The declarations of this note live in seven modules: `RationalBaseLambert`, `QAperyDiagonalNonEquivalence`, `RationalPadeArithmetic`, `ZudilinConeArithmetic`, `ZudilinHeightRegion`, `HermitePadeNoGo`, and `BezoutPluckerJets`. The first contains the corridor, cleared-tail recurrence, and elementary $`7/2`$ certificate; the second checks the finite $`n=0`$ diagonal residual; the remaining four separate the Padé exponent arithmetic, endpoint arithmetic, logarithmic comparisons, rectangular exponent model, and Bézout–Plücker tail collapse. The link coordinates are validated against that pinned revision, so they remain correct as later work moves lines in the working tree.

The remark that the results extend to non-integer $`p=r/s`$, $`|p|>1`$, under an assumption $`\log|r|>c\log|s|`$ for a computable $`c>0`$, is at the end of the introduction; no value of $`c`$ is computed there.
