# Critical-Value Separation and Admissible Hubs

<div class="center">

<span class="smallcaps">Abstract</span>

</div>

Let $`f(z)=\prod_i(z-z_i)`$ be monic with roots in the closed unit disc. Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian ask whether two roots can always be joined by a curve of length less than $`2`$ inside $`\{|f|<1\}`$. The global assertion remains open.

The strongest all-degree sufficient regime proved here is controlled by critical-value separation. Let $`c`$ be a simple critical point with $`v=f(c)\ne0`$. If every other critical point $`d`$ satisfies $`|1-f(d)/v|\ge S>1`$, then the square-root-resolved inverse branch through $`c`$ gives a root connector of length at most
``` math
2|v|^{1/n}(1+S)^{1/n}
       \sqrt{\log\!\frac{S}{S-1}}
```
inside $`\{|f|\le|v|\}`$. Hence the connector is shorter than $`2|v|^{1/n}`$ whenever $`(1+S)^{2/n}\log(S/(S-1))<1`$. Exact uniform choices are $`S=4`$ for $`n\ge3`$, $`S=3`$ for $`n\ge4`$, and $`S=2`$ for $`n\ge6`$. For roots in the open unit disc these hypotheses prove Erdős #1041 for the polynomial. The analytic proof, degree monotonicity, threshold estimates and length consequence are ordinary mathematics; no Lean formalisation of this separation theorem or its numerical kernel is supplied here.

A second all-degree result is sharp rather than merely sufficient: for collinear zeros of diameter $`D`$, one adjacent-root segment lies below $`C_n(D/2)^n`$, where $`C_n=(2^{n-1}\cos^n(\pi/(2n)))^{-1}`$, and equality occurs for affine Chebyshev configurations. We also close the primitive sparse quintic family and every translated cubic quotient-fibre family of degree $`3q`$, $`q\ge2`$. For each family the exact Lean-checked selector is displayed separately from the ordinary normalization, fibre, moment, and path assembly. A further unconditional auxiliary theorem gives the sharp critical-value budget $`\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}|f(c_j)|^{1/n}\le(n-1)R`$ for $`2\le n\le5`$, where $`R`$ is the radius of an enclosing root disk. Its proof combines finite disk inequalities with a plurisubharmonic boundary reduction; it controls merge levels, not the lengths of the paths reaching them.

This result exposes rather than hides the surviving frontier: it gives no control when critical values form a near tie, and it excludes multiple saddles. Those are precisely the clustered regimes still requiring a grouped contour, an admissible-hub selector, or another argument. Complementary exact inputs sharpen that boundary. At every critical point, two nearest-root occurrences have total Euclidean distance at most $`2`$; Lean checks the reciprocal critical balance and disk inverse-square estimate used by the ordinary polynomial-level argument, but these estimates alone do not prove containment. An exact quintic has a nearest straight spoke that leaves $`\{|f|<1\}`$, and an exact cubic has an escaping midpoint on every straight root-pair segment.

Along the complex Newton field $`-f/f'`$, the value satisfies $`f(z(t))=e^{-t}f(z(0))`$. Lean checks this value equation, the resulting positive-ray obstruction to finite saddle connections, and the finite translation and root-retention interfaces.

Outside the separated regime, the remaining metric problem is one of admissible-hub selection. On the ray-separated dense class, one must find a critical hub $`c`$ whose two inverse-ray arms stay in the relevant component and satisfy
``` math
\min_{c\ \mathrm{admissible}} L(c)\le2.
```
At degree five, a critical value at most $`1/M_5`$, where
``` math
M_5=(1-t_*)(1+t_*)^3\sqrt{16t_*^2-4t_*+1},
 \qquad t_*={5\over16}+{3\sqrt{105}\over80},
 \qquad 1/M_5=0.2760461\ldots,
```
would give two contained nearest-root spokes of total length at most $`2`$. The near-Fekete reduction removes radial deficits from this containment question, but neither the general hub selection nor its degree-five form is proved. The threshold and no-go witnesses are ordinary proofs, exact certificates, or computations, not additional kernel-checked theorems. Coefficient genericity, component stability, planar topology, and metric gluing remain open.

<div class="center">

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What the analysis isolates**

**Exact inputs.** Critical-point balance gives two nearest-root distances with total at most $`2`$, while the Newton flow transports $`f`$ exactly by $`f(z(t))=e^{-t}f(z(0))`$. Exact examples show why straight spokes and root-pair segments do not solve the containment problem. **Sharp degree-five target.** A critical value at most $`1/M_5`$ would suffice. **Proved algebraic budget.** The sum of critical-value $`n`$-th roots is at most $`(n-1)R`$ through degree five; converting this budget into short contained paths is a separate metric problem. **Open boundary.** The missing theorem is an admissible critical hub whose inverse-ray arms stay in the right component and meet the metric bound.

> **Contribution.** The paper proves an all-degree critical-value-separation regime by a resolved inverse branch, the area formula, Pólya’s area–capacity inequality, and an exact coefficient estimate. It proves a sharp all-degree collinear theorem, a complete primitive sparse quintic theorem, and translated cubic quotient-fibre theorems in every degree $`3q`$. It also checks exponential Newton-value decay, positive-ray collision interfaces, finite translation avoidance, and quantified root retention, and records the current near-Fekete residual.
>
> **Relation to the open problem.** The separation and three solved-family assemblies are ordinary mathematics, not kernel-checked authority. It excludes near-tied critical values and multiple saddles. The checked dynamical and perturbative inputs do not repair the global topology and metric gluing in those complementary strata, so Problem #1041 remains open. The degree-five target and the no-go witnesses are boundaries around the open theorem, not a hidden closure.
>
> **Executable review object.** Comparator selects the finite-family small-translation theorem and the quantified root-retention theorem and three solved-family kernels. Critical-value separation, including its threshold analysis, has no corresponding formal endpoint in the pinned corpus. Each formal endpoint routes to the exact paper result and boundary it supports; the covering-space and area argument and the frontier section remain ordinary evidence classes. The repository’s external-verification job compares these exact Lean propositions with separately declared challenge statements and an axiom budget, then asks Lean’s kernel to check the submitted proofs. The [formalisation manifest](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ca0e13f8acf5ccf48506e4bdb870953d3a0856fa/formalization.yaml) and the commit-bound CI receipt record that check; they do not assess novelty, significance, or whether the original problem is solved.

The two selected perturbation interfaces have the following exact boundaries. For a finite type $`\iota`$, an injective family of critical values $`c\colon\iota\to\mathbb C`$, and every $`\varepsilon>0`$, the row `exists_small_translation_separating_arguments` supplies a shift of norm less than $`\varepsilon`$ such that every translated value is nonzero and every two distinct translated values lie on different positive rays. Separately, for a monic split polynomial of positive degree whose roots have norm at most $`\rho`$, the row `constant_perturbation_roots_in_unitDisk` requires $`\rho\ge0`$, $`\varepsilon>0`$, the margin
``` math
((\operatorname{natDegree}f+1)\varepsilon)^{1/\operatorname{natDegree}f}
   +\rho<1,
```
and a shift of norm less than $`\varepsilon`$; it then places every root of $`f+\operatorname{C}(\text{shift})`$ in the open unit disc. These are finite perturbation and stability interfaces only: neither row supplies the missing global topology or the length-$`2`$ gluing argument.

# The problem

<div id="res:problem" class="problem">

**Problem 1** (Erdős \#1041). Let $`f(z)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}(z-z_i)`$ be monic with $`z_i\in\mathbb{D}`$, the open unit disc. Show that two of the roots can be joined by a curve of length less than $`2`$ lying in the open lemniscate $`E=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|f(z)|<1\}`$.

</div>

Numbering and current status follow Bloom’s Erdős problem catalogue \[bloom\]. The problem is open. The original source is Problem 5 on printed p. 139 of Erdős–Herzog–Piranian \[ehp1958, p. 139\]; the preceding paragraph records the known input that one component of the lemniscate contains at least two zeros.

Recent work on polynomial lemniscates separates component counts from metric path questions. Ghosh and Ramachandran characterize the number of components through critical points and critical values \[ghosh2023, Lemma 7\]; for the binomial family $`z^n-a`$, the condition $`|a|<1`$ puts the filled unit lemniscate in the connected regime. Connectedness alone gives no path-length bound. Our dynamical terminology is also standard: Sutherland calls $`\dot z=-f(z)/f'(z)`$ the continuous Newton flow and observes that $`f(z(t))`$ moves on a straight radial line \[sutherland1992, p. 42\]. We use this value-space identity, not a claim that the global trajectory graph is a tree.

Two recent manuscripts are relevant. The 48-page manuscript posted by `shtuka` on 24 March 2026 \[march2026, Theorem 1, p. 1\] claims the unrestricted statement. Its Proposition 12 (p. 16, with proof continuing through p. 30) supplies the spanning-tree decomposition used in the final proof. The defect was located publicly in the problem’s discussion thread: on 25 March 2026 Tao observed that the invocation of Lemma 8 there is unjustified and that the flow lines need not organise into connected trees, and on 26 March 2026 the manuscript’s author agreed that the statement of Proposition 12 itself, not only its printed proof, is incorrect, and set the strategy aside. Section <a href="#sec:gap" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:gap">7</a> records an independent diagnosis of the same failure through the local three-ended saddle model, together with possible repairs. No counterexample to the proposition is exhibited there. Pendyala’s independent June 2026 preprint \[june2026, Thm. 1, p. 1\] proves the degree-four case. The quartic theorem does not close the problem.

We study the Newton flow whose trajectories foliate the lemniscate.

*Status.* The problem treated here is open, and this note does not close it. Every statement below marked as checked is a proposition that the pinned Lean kernel accepts from the sources this note links to, with no `sorry`, no added axiom, and no unchecked evaluation. That is a claim about the formal statement, not about its mathematical interest, its novelty, or the original problem. The unresolved obligations are named exactly, in their own section, and none of the finite computations, reductions, or no-go results here removes one of them.

*Companion system context.* The [claim and trust boundary](../../../claim-faithful-publication-systems-paper.pdf#nameddest=systems-trust), [cold-clone route to proof authority](../../../cold-clone-to-proof-receipt.pdf#nameddest=cold-clone-authority), and [public contribution protocol](../../../open-source-mathematics-strategy.pdf#nameddest=strategy-protocol) are described in sibling papers. Those descriptions do not change the mathematical status of this note.

# An all-degree critical-value separation theorem

The first result is the strongest direct parent-theorem regime in this note. It is not a statement about a sampled family or a fixed degree: the condition is an exact inequality on the other critical values after normalising one simple first-merge hub.

<div id="res:critical-value-separation" class="theorem">

**Theorem 2** (critical-value separation). *Let $`P`$ be a polynomial of degree $`n\ge3`$ whose leading coefficient has modulus one. Suppose
``` math
P(0)=1,\qquad P'(0)=0,\qquad P''(0)\ne0,
```
and, for some $`S>1`$, every other critical point $`d\ne0`$ satisfies
``` math
|1-P(d)|\ge S.
```
If $`Z`$ is either local solution at the saddle of
``` math
P(Z(\xi))=1-\xi^2,\qquad Z(0)=0,
```
then $`Z`$ continues holomorphically and injectively to $`|\xi|<\sqrt S`$. Its endpoints $`Z(-1)`$ and $`Z(1)`$ are distinct roots, and their resolved inverse-ray connector satisfies
``` math
\int_{-1}^{1}|Z'(\xi)|\,d\xi
 \le 2(1+S)^{1/n}\sqrt{\log\!\frac{S}{S-1}}.       \tag{4}
```
In particular the connector has length strictly below $`2`$ whenever
``` math
(1+S)^{2/n}\log\!\frac{S}{S-1}<1.                 \tag{5}
```*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* The simple saddle has local form $`P(z)=1+Az^2+O(z^3)`$ with $`A\ne0`$, so the substitution $`P(Z(\xi))=1-\xi^2`$ resolves it into two local holomorphic sheets. Normalize the algebraic curve $`X=\{(\xi,z):P(z)=1-\xi^2\}`$. A finite ramification point of its projection to the $`\xi`$-plane can occur only at a critical point $`d`$ of $`P`$, where $`\xi^2=1-P(d)`$. The node over $`(0,0)`$ is replaced in the normalization by the two resolved local points, and the separation hypothesis puts every other ramification point on or outside $`|\xi|=\sqrt S`$. Polynomial properness makes the normalized projection finite and proper. Its inverse image over $`D_{\sqrt S}`$ is therefore an unramified finite cover. Since the disc is simply connected, every connected cover component maps biholomorphically to it; in particular either resolved local sheet continues as a single holomorphic branch $`Z`$ throughout the disc.

This branch is also injective as a map into the $`z`$-plane. Indeed, $`Z(\xi_1)=Z(\xi_2)`$ implies $`\xi_1^2=\xi_2^2`$. The involution $`\iota(\xi,z)=(-\xi,z)`$ exchanges the two distinct normalized points over $`(0,0)`$ and hence exchanges their two cover components. If $`\xi_2=-\xi_1\ne0`$ and $`Z(\xi_1)=Z(\xi_2)`$, one component would meet its $`\iota`$-image; connected cover components are disjoint, so they would have to coincide, contradicting the two distinct points over $`0`$. Thus $`\xi_1=\xi_2`$.

Write $`Z(\xi)=\sum_{k\ge1}a_k\xi^k`$. For $`1<R<\sqrt S`$, injectivity and the area formula give
``` math
\pi\sum_{k\ge1}k|a_k|^2R^{2k}
   =\operatorname{Area}(Z(D_R)).                    \tag{6}
```
The identity $`P(Z(\xi))=1-\xi^2`$ places the image in $`\{|P|<1+R^2\}`$. Since the leading coefficient of $`P`$ has modulus one, Pólya’s area–capacity inequality \[polya1928, printed pp. 280–282\] yields
``` math
\operatorname{Area}(Z(D_R))
 \le \operatorname{Area}\{|P|<1+R^2\}
 \le \pi(1+R^2)^{2/n}.                              \tag{7}
```
Cauchy–Schwarz applied to (6)–(7) now gives
``` math
\sum_{k\ge1}|a_k|
 \le (1+R^2)^{1/n}
      \sqrt{\sum_{k\ge1}\frac1{kR^{2k}}}
 = (1+R^2)^{1/n}\sqrt{\log\!\frac{R^2}{R^2-1}}.   \tag{8}
```
Termwise integration on $`[-1,1]`$ gives $`\int_{-1}^{1}|Z'|\le2\sum_{k\ge1}|a_k|`$. Letting $`R\nearrow\sqrt S`$ proves (4). Injectivity makes $`Z(-1)`$ and $`Z(1)`$ distinct, while $`P(Z(\xi))=1-\xi^2\in[0,1]`$ on the real segment proves the claimed containment. Squaring (4) gives (5). ◻

<div id="res:critical-value-thresholds" class="corollary">

**Corollary 3** (exact convenient thresholds). *Condition *(5)* holds for
``` math
(n,S)=(n,4)\quad(n\ge3),\qquad
 (n,3)\quad(n\ge4),\qquad
 (n,2)\quad(n\ge6).
```
If $`f`$ is monic with roots in the open unit disc, $`c`$ is a simple critical point with $`v=f(c)\ne0`$, and every other critical point satisfies the corresponding inequality $`|1-f(d)/v|\ge S`$, then two roots of $`f`$ are joined inside $`\{|f|<1\}`$ by a curve of length strictly below $`2`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* For $`S=4`$ and $`n\ge3`$,
``` math
5^{2/n}\log(4/3)
 \le5^{2/3}\log(1+1/3)<5^{2/3}/3<1,
```
where the last radical inequality is $`25<27`$. For $`S=3`$ and $`n\ge4`$, $`4^{2/n}\log(3/2)\le2\log(1+1/2)<1`$. For $`S=2`$ and $`n\ge6`$, use the exact bound $`\log2<0.6931471808=:c`$. For example, summing the first nine terms of $`\log2=2\sum_{k\ge0}((2k+1)3^{2k+1})^{-1}`$ and bounding the positive remainder geometrically gives
``` math
\log2\le2\sum_{k=0}^{8}\frac1{(2k+1)3^{2k+1}}
       +\frac9{4\cdot19\cdot3^{19}}<c.
```
Exact rational arithmetic gives $`3c^3<1`$, so $`3^{2/n}\log2\le3^{1/3}\log2<3^{1/3}c<1`$.

For the polynomial $`f`$, set $`z=c+\rho e^{i\theta}w`$ with $`\rho=|v|^{1/n}`$ and choose $`\theta`$ so that $`P(w)=f(z)/v`$ has unit-modulus leading coefficient. The theorem gives a connector of length strictly below $`2|v|^{1/n}`$ inside $`\{|f|\le|v|\}`$. For each displayed threshold $`S\ge2`$, separation gives $`|f(d)|\ge(S-1)|v|\ge|v|`$ at every other critical point, so $`|v|=\mu`$ is the least critical-value modulus. If the roots lie in a disc of radius $`R<1`$, the resultant identity and Fekete’s Vandermonde bound give, with critical points counted with multiplicity,
``` math
\mu^{n-1}
 \le \prod_{f'(d)=0}|f(d)|
 =\frac{|\operatorname{Disc}(f)|}{n^n}
 =\frac{\prod_{i<j}|z_i-z_j|^2}{n^n}
 \le R^{n(n-1)}.
```
Thus $`|v|=\mu\le R^n<1`$, so both the length and containment are strict at the target scale. ◻

#### Evidence and exact boundary.

The analytic continuation, monodromy, area formula and Pólya inequality in Theorem <a href="#res:critical-value-separation" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:critical-value-separation">2</a> are ordinary mathematics. The companion symbolic replay checks the branch-value algebra, all three exact constant chains, and the nonempty boundary example $`P(z)=1-3z^2+z^3`$, whose other critical point is $`2`$ and satisfies $`1-P(2)=4`$. The degree monotonicity, exact threshold inequalities and conversion from the squared estimate to a strict length bound are also ordinary arguments. No corresponding Lean declaration is supplied by the pinned corpus; the symbolic replay is not a kernel-checked proof of the analytic theorem or its scalar consequences.

The boundary is structural, not cosmetic. This method says nothing when a second critical value enters the resolved disc, and it assumes the selected saddle is simple. It therefore leaves the near-tie and multiple-saddle strata, makes no sharpness claim for the convenient thresholds, and does not prove an unrestricted admissible-hub selector, a COVER theorem, or Erdős #1041. No novelty or priority claim is made here for the use of Pólya’s global area inequality; the contribution asserted is the displayed composed sufficient regime and its exact constants. Pólya is cited only for that global input, not for the square-resolved covering and coefficient assembly.

# Three exact solved polynomial families

The next three theorems are unconditional subcases of the path problem, not proxies for the unrestricted conjecture. They are ordered by mathematical signal rather than by the date of their formalization: first an all-degree sharp theorem with equality configurations, then a complete degree-five sparse family, and finally an infinite tower of translated quotient fibres. In each case a displayed finite proposition is the exact Comparator-selected Lean endpoint. The ensuing normalization and path theorem is ordinary mathematics and is stated separately.

The constant in *(9)* is best possible in every degree. Equality is attained by affine images of the zeros of $`T_n`$ whose extreme zeros have distance $`D`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* A repeated zero gives the constant path, so assume the zero values are distinct. A rigid motion sends their line to the real axis, their midpoint to the origin, and their extremes to $`\pm D/2`$. With $`R=D/2`$, the normalized polynomial
``` math
q(w)=R^{-n}e^{-in\theta}f(m+Re^{i\theta}w)
```
is monic with real zeros $`-1=y_1<\cdots<y_n=1`$, and $`|f(m+Re^{i\theta}w)|=R^n|q(w)|`$.

Compare $`q`$ with the monic endpoint-normalized Chebyshev polynomial
``` math
q_*(x)=\frac{T_n(r_nx)}{2^{n-1}r_n^n}.
```
Both $`q`$ and $`q_*`$ vanish at $`\pm1`$, and $`|q_*|\le C_n`$ on $`[-1,1]`$. For each gap $`[y_i,y_{i+1}]`$, choose $`c_i`$ at which $`|q|`$ is maximal. The signs of $`q(c_i)`$ alternate. If every gap maximum were larger than $`C_n`$, then $`q-q_*`$ would have the same alternating signs as $`q`$ at the $`c_i`$. It would therefore have a zero between each consecutive pair $`c_i,c_{i+1}`$, as well as the two zeros $`\pm1`$. These are $`n`$ distinct zeros, whereas the leading terms cancel and $`\deg(q-q_*)\le n-1`$; moreover $`q-q_*`$ is nonzero at every $`c_i`$. This contradiction selects a gap on which $`|q|\le C_n`$. Scaling back proves *(9)*.

For sharpness, take
``` math
y_k=\frac{\cos((2k-1)\pi/(2n))}{r_n},
 \qquad 1\le k\le n.
```
These are the zeros of $`q_*`$, have extremes $`\pm1`$, and every adjacent gap contains a scaled Chebyshev extremum where $`|q_*|=C_n`$. No smaller universal constant can work. ◻

E_i=s_i^4(s_i+r^2+2rx_i).

This is the exact finite conclusion selected as . It selects two distinct indices. It does not assert that the corresponding complex root values are distinct.

<div id="thm:primitive-quintic-two-tail" class="theorem">

**Theorem 8** (primitive sparse quintic). *Let
``` math
p(z)=z^5+az^4+bz+c

``` math
|bw_i+c|\le1.                                    \tag{11}

If $`a\ne0`$, two indices can be chosen with strict inequalities. If $`a=0`$, every index satisfies *(11)*, and equality holds exactly when $`|w_i|=1`$.*

*For open-disc zeros, two zero occurrences are joined inside $`\{|p|<1\}`$ by a curve of length below $`2`$: use the two radial spokes through $`0`$ when their values are distinct, and the constant path when the selected occurrences have the same value.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Rotate so that $`a=re^{i\phi}`$ becomes $`r\ge0`$ and write $`z_i=e^{-i\phi}w_i`$. The missing $`z^3`$ and $`z^2`$ coefficients and Newton’s identities give
``` math
\sum z_i=-r,\qquad \sum z_i^2=r^2,\qquad
 \sum z_i^3=-r^3.                                 \tag{12}
```
At a zero,
``` math
|bw_i+c|=|w_i|^4|w_i+a|.
```
Thus, for $`x_i=\Re z_i`$ and $`s_i=|z_i|^2`$, the squared tail is exactly $`E_i`$ and *(12)* becomes *(10)*. If $`r>0`$, the third moment also gives $`r^3=|\sum_i z_i^3|\le5<8`$, so $`r<2`$ as required by the selector.

For completeness, the selector is driven by the harmonic extension
``` math
H_r(x,s)=(-r/2-x)(1-x)^2
 +(1-s)\left(1-\frac r4-\frac{3x}{4}\right).
```
The three moments give the exact sum
``` math
\sum_{i=0}^4H_r(x_i,s_i)=5-2r,                  \tag{13}
```
while $`H_r\le4-2r`$ throughout the unit disc. If $`E_r(x,s)\ge1`$, then
``` math
5(1-s)\le2r(x+r/2).
```
Put $`d=x+r/2`$, $`u=1-x`$, $`A=1-r/4-3x/4`$, and $`P=-u^2+(2r/5)A`$. The unsafe inequality gives $`0\le d<2`$. Since $`H_r=-du^2+(1-s)A`$, it is nonpositive when $`A\le0`$; when $`A>0`$, the preceding bound gives $`H_r\le dP`$. The remaining estimate is the exact sum-of-squares identity
``` math
\frac1{31}-P
 =\frac25\left(d-\frac{38}{31}
               +\frac14(u-\frac3{31})\right)^2
  +\frac{31}{40}\left(u-\frac3{31}\right)^2\ge0,
```
which gives $`P\le1/31`$, and hence $`H_r(x,s)\le2/31`$ whether $`P`$ is positive or nonpositive. Thus every unsafe tail has this smaller score. If four tails were unsafe, *(13)* would give
``` math
5-2r\le4-2r+\frac8{31}<5-2r,
```
a contradiction. This proves the two-index conclusion. The case $`r=0`$ is the direct identity $`|bw_i+c|=|w_i|^5`$.

Finally, at a zero $`w`$,
``` math
p(tw)=(1-t)c+(t-t^4)(bw+c)-t^4(1-t)w^5.
```
For $`0\le t\le1`$ the three nonnegative coefficients sum to $`1-t^5`$. The tail bound, $`|w|\le1`$, and $`|c|\le1`$ therefore give the radial unit-sublevel path. Under the open-disc hypothesis the relevant bounds and the total spoke length $`|w_i|+|w_j|`$ are strict. ◻

```
If every zero of $`f`$ lies in the open unit disc and $`f`$ has at least two distinct zero values, then two zeros are joined through $`h`$ by a two-segment path of length below $`2`$ inside $`\{|f|<1\}`$. Equivalently this closes the coefficient family
``` math
(z-h)^{3q}+A(z-h)^{2q}+B(z-h)^q+C
```
in every degree $`3q\ge6`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Fix a $`q`$th root $`y`$ of a quotient root and a primitive $`q`$th root of unity $`\zeta`$. The full fibre consists of $`h+y\zeta^k`$. Since every fibre point lies in the open unit disc,
``` math
\frac1q\sum_{k=0}^{q-1}|h+y\zeta^k|^2
   =|h|^2+|y|^2<1.                                \tag{14}
```
Thus $`|y|<1`$, and the corresponding quotient root has modulus $`|y|^q<1`$. This verifies the open-disc hypothesis for all quotient roots before applying the following selector.

Write $`P(w)=(w-r)(w-s)(w-v)`$ and assign to $`r`$ the charge $`A_r=\Re(r\overline{s+v})`$, cyclically. The exact sum is
``` math
A_r+A_s+A_v=|r+s+v|^2-(|r|^2+|s|^2+|v|^2)>-3,
```
so one charge, say $`A_r`$, exceeds $`-1`$. For $`0\le t\le1`$, AM–GM and the distance-square identity give
``` math
|tr-s|\,|tr-v|<1+t+t^2.
```
Consequently, for $`0\le t<1`$,
``` math
|P(tr)|<(1-t)(1+t+t^2)=1-t^3\le1.              \tag{15}
```
At $`t=1`$ the polynomial vanishes. The entire spoke is therefore strictly contained, including its origin endpoint.

For a nonzero safe quotient root from *(15)*, two distinct fibre points satisfy
``` math
f(h+ty\zeta^k)=P(t^qr),
```
and their two spokes through $`h`$ have total length $`2|y|<2`$. If the selected quotient root is zero, choose a nonzero quotient root and use the direct estimate $`|P(ts)|<2t(1-t)\le1/2`$ for $`0<t<1`$, with zero values at both endpoints; if none exists, $`f`$ has only one distinct zero value, contrary to the hypothesis. ◻

# The current frontier: what survives near Fekete configurations

The August 29 public research update changes the useful first reading of this problem. It does not add a proof of Erdős #1041; it identifies the geometric regime in which the remaining difficulty is concentrated and kills several attractive but false shortcuts. The source of the update is pinned to commit [`f214a6b4`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/tree/f214a6b45528dc5eefe20ffadc35f2e981627d4c/research_corpus/Erdos1041) and the dated synthesis is [`FRONTIER.md`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/f214a6b45528dc5eefe20ffadc35f2e981627d4c/research_corpus/Erdos1041/FRONTIER.md). The distinctions below are part of the result: a theorem, a refutation, a certificate, and a measurement do not have interchangeable force.

<a id="near-fekete-stability-removes-the-radial-distraction"></a>

## Near-Fekete stability removes the radial distraction

Write $`a_i=\rho_i u_i`$, with $`|u_i|=1`$, and put $`D=|\operatorname{disc}(f)|/n^n`$. The quantitative Fekete–Hadamard estimate in [`NearFeketeRadialAngularSplit.md`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/f214a6b45528dc5eefe20ffadc35f2e981627d4c/research_corpus/Erdos1041/NearFeketeRadialAngularSplit.md) says that, when $`D\ge1-\eta`$ and $`\eta\le1/(80n^2)`$,
``` math
1-\rho_i^2\le \frac{n\eta}{n-1},\qquad
  |a_i-a_j|\ge \frac{2-2\sqrt\eta-n\eta}{n-1},
```
and the roots lie within $`7\sqrt\eta`$ of a rotated regular $`n`$-gon, after a bijection. The mechanism is a normalised Vandermonde Gram determinant: near equality in Hadamard’s inequality forces both the radii and the angular separation to be near extremal. This is an ordinary mathematical result in the public research corpus, not a new Lean declaration.

The associated radial monotonicity theorem is the more important reader conclusion. Under the stronger near-Fekete condition $`\eta\le1/(10n^4)`$ used by this corollary, replacing the radii by one can only increase the values along the corresponding radial spoke. Thus radial deficits help containment; the unresolved near-Fekete problem is angular. On exact regular-gon directions this becomes unconditional for $`n\le6`$: arbitrary radii in the stated band give
``` math
|f(s\,\omega\zeta^i)|\le1-s^n
 \quad(0\le s\le\rho_i),
```
so every two-radii path is contained. The good spoke in the general on-circle averaging identity may move with $`s`$, however; that is why an existence statement at one level does not supply a fixed pair of roots.

<a id="a-bounded-radius-concyclic-class"></a>

## A bounded-radius concyclic class

There is nevertheless a clean theorem for a different on-circle mechanism. Let $`f`$ be monic of degree $`n\ge3`$ with distinct zeros on a circle of radius $`\rho`$. If $`2\rho^n\le1`$, two adjacent zeros are joined by their straight chord, whose length is at most $`2\rho\sin(\pi/n)<2`$, and the chord lies in $`\{|f|<1\}`$. (If a zero is repeated, the short-connection conclusion is immediate; the distinct case is the substantive one.)

After normalisation to the unit circle, self-inversive realification and alternation against $`z^n-c`$ select a zero-free gap on which the polynomial modulus is at most $`2`$; a harmonic normal-derivative argument transfers this arc bound strictly to the chord. The complete ordinary proof is [`ConcyclicAlternation.md`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/f214a6b45528dc5eefe20ffadc35f2e981627d4c/research_corpus/Erdos1041/ConcyclicAlternation.md).

The argument is an ordinary proof outside Lean. The [exact-rational checker](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/f214a6b45528dc5eefe20ffadc35f2e981627d4c/research_corpus/Erdos1041/scripts/check_erdos1041_concyclic_exact_witness.py) checks finitely many load-bearing identities and configurations, while the [numerical checker](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/f214a6b45528dc5eefe20ffadc35f2e981627d4c/research_corpus/Erdos1041/scripts/check_erdos1041_concyclic_alternation.py) is regression and stress-test evidence. The arc constant $`2`$ is sharp on the regular $`n`$-gon, so this chord argument does not reach radii tending to $`1`$; the unrestricted concyclic case and Erdős #1041 remain open.

<a id="cyclic-trinomial-fibres"></a>

## Cyclic trinomial fibres

There is also a positive structured family in every cyclic lift degree. Fix integers $`1\le r\le m`$ and $`q\ge1`$, and consider the translated polynomial
``` math
f(z)=(z-h)^{qm}+a(z-h)^{qr}+c.
```
Writing $`w=(z-h)^q`$ reduces the root equation to $`w^m+aw^r+c=0`$. At such a quotient root the middle coefficient can be eliminated exactly: for $`0\le u\le1`$,
``` math
u^mw^m+au^rw^r+c
   =(1-u^r)c-(u^r-u^m)w^m.
```
The two coefficients on the right are nonnegative and have total at most one. Lean therefore proves that, if $`|w|<1`$ and $`|c|<1`$, the complete radial spoke is strictly contained in the open unit lemniscate. This is an all-root statement; no Vieta-small root selection is needed for the containment bound.

For a nontrivial cyclic fibre, two selected displacements $`y_1,y_2`$ with $`|y_1|,|y_2|<1`$ also satisfy $`|y_1|+|y_2|<2`$. The formal source checks the factorization, strict spoke estimate, and this metric budget. It does not yet check the ordinary finite argument selecting a suitable quotient root and two distinct members of its fibre, lifting both quotient spokes, or assembling their union as a path in the relevant component. Thus the Lean theorem is the load-bearing analytic kernel for this translated cyclic-trinomial family, not the complete path theorem and not a proof of unrestricted Erdős #1041.

<a id="coefficient-controlled-cyclic-tetranomial-spokes"></a>

## Coefficient-controlled cyclic tetranomial spokes

The first additional lower monomial admits an exact Abel-tail criterion. Let
``` math
g(w)=w^m+aw^r+bw^s+c,\qquad m>r>s\ge1,
```
assume all roots of $`g`$ lie in the open unit disk, and let $`w_1,w_2`$ be roots of the two smallest moduli. If
``` math
|c|+|b|\,|w_2|^s<1,
```
then the complete radial spokes from $`w_1`$ and $`w_2`$ to the origin lie in $`\{|g|<1\}`$, and their broken line has length strictly below $`2`$. The simpler coefficient condition
``` math
|b|+|c|\le1
```
makes every root spoke safe; the coefficient $`a`$ is unrestricted.

The mechanism is visible in one identity. At a root $`w`$ and for $`0\le u\le1`$,
``` math
\begin{split}
 g(uw)={}&(1-u^s)c
  -(u^s-u^r)(aw^r+w^m)
  -(u^r-u^m)w^m,\\
 aw^r+w^m={}&-(c+bw^s).
\end{split}
```
The three scalar coefficients are nonnegative and sum to $`1-u^m`$. Thus the root-dependent budget $`|c|+|b||w|^s<1`$, together with $`|w|<1`$ and $`|c|<1`$, puts every vector in the Abel decomposition strictly inside the unit ball. Lean checks this factorization and the resulting strict spoke theorem under the exact weak exponent hypotheses $`1\le s\le r\le m`$; it also checks the coefficient-only corollary above.

There is a stronger, genuinely two-index formal theorem. Let $`S`$ index a finite family of roots, $`N=|S|\ge2`$, and
``` math
M=\sum_{i\in S}w_i^s.
```
Lean proves the exact signed energy identity
``` math
\sum_{i\in S}|c+bw_i^s|^2
 =N|c|^2+|b|^2\sum_{i\in S}|w_i^s|^2
   +2\mathop{\rm Re}(\overline c\,bM).
```
Consequently, if every $`|w_i|<1`$, $`|c|<1`$, and
``` math
N\bigl(|b|^2+|c|^2\bigr)
   +2\mathop{\rm Re}(\overline c\,bM)<N-1,
```
then two distinct indices $`i,j\in S`$ satisfy $`|c+bw_i^s|<1`$ and $`|c+bw_j^s|<1`$. Feeding those inequalities into the Abel decomposition proves, in Lean, that both complete root spokes lie strictly in $`\{|g|<1\}`$. The signed cross term is essential: this interface can certify configurations outside the coefficient-only triangle $`|b|+|c|\le1`$. The formal hypotheses do not require $`i\mapsto w_i`$ to be injective, so distinct indices need not denote distinct root values; the ordinary two-root consequence requires a root enumeration without repetition.

For $`q\ge2`$ and $`f(z)=g((z-h)^q)`$, the ordinary regular-fibre mean-square identity puts every quotient root inside the unit disk. Lifting two selected quotient spokes gives a path through $`h`$ whose two displacement lengths sum to less than $`2`$. The new Lean theorem assumes the finite root family, its signed moment $`M`$, and the displayed budget; it does not derive that budget from arbitrary tetranomial coefficients, prove that the supplied family is a complete root multiset, perform cyclic-fibre lifting, or construct the final path object. Without the signed-moment, root-dependent, or coefficient-only budget, the tetranomial case remains open; this family does not solve unrestricted Erdős #1041.

<a id="sec:translated-quartic-quotient-fibres"></a>

## Translated quartic quotient fibres

Pendyala’s degree-four theorem can also be lifted through every nontrivial cyclic power. Let $`P`$ be a monic quartic, let $`q\ge2`$, and set
``` math
f(z)=P((z-h)^q).
```
If all listed zeros of $`f`$ lie in the open unit disk, averaging the squared moduli over each complete $`q`$-point fibre shows that every quotient root $`w`$ of $`P`$ satisfies $`|w|<1`$. Pendyala’s chord-or-radial proof then supplies the quotient geometry. The extra issue is metric: a short chord in the $`w`$-plane need not lift isometrically through $`y\mapsto y^q`$.

Put $`\alpha=1/q`$. Along a quotient chord whose supporting line has distance $`d`$ from the origin, the root-lift density is controlled pointwise by
``` math
\bigl(\sqrt{d^2+x^2}\bigr)^{\alpha-1}
    \le x^{\alpha-1}\qquad(x>0),
```
and Lean checks the exact primitive
``` math
\alpha\int_0^A x^{\alpha-1}\,dx=A^\alpha.
```
Splitting at the perpendicular foot, and at the origin when the chord crosses it, yields the ordinary power-map chord-lift estimate
``` math
\operatorname{length}(\widetilde{[a,b]})
    \le |a|^{1/q}+|b|^{1/q}.
```
The formal source also checks the strict endpoint consumer: if $`0\le a,b<1`$, $`\alpha>0`$, and a candidate length $`L`$ is at most $`a^\alpha+b^\alpha`$, then $`L<2`$. Thus both Pendyala branches survive the power-map lift, giving the asserted short path for every translated quartic quotient fibre, in each degree $`4q\ge8`$.

The attribution and proof boundary are exact. Pendyala proves the quartic geometric theorem and its four-point radial lemma. The local Lean module checks the antitone density inequality, its integral, the strict powered endpoint budget, and the final length fan-in. It does not formalize Pendyala’s geometric lemma, the continuous covering-space construction of the root lift, or the ordinary chord/radial case assembly. This is a structured all-scale family, not a proof of unrestricted Erdős #1041.

<a id="a-critical-value-budget-through-degree-five"></a>

## A critical-value budget through degree five

The critical values satisfy a sharp aggregate bound in the first four nontrivial degrees. This gives a budget for the merge levels; it does not bound the lengths of the paths that reach them.

<div id="res:critical-value-budget" class="theorem">

**Theorem 11** (critical-value budget in degrees two through five). *Let $`f`$ be monic of degree $`2\le n\le5`$, with roots in a disk of radius $`R`$. If $`c_1,\ldots,c_{n-1}`$ are its critical points counted with multiplicity, then
``` math
\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}|f(c_j)|^{1/n}\le(n-1)R.
```
The constant is attained by $`f(z)=(z-\tau)^n-\lambda`$ with enclosing disk centred at $`\tau`$ and radius $`R=|\lambda|^{1/n}`$.*

</div>

The finite inequality behind the theorem concerns arbitrary points of the disk, without asking them to arise as critical points. Write $`(\mathrm{FP}_m)`$ for
``` math
\sum_{j=1}^m\left(\prod_{k=1}^m
       |1-\overline{c_j}c_k|\right)^{1/m}\le m,
 \qquad |c_j|\le1.
```
We first establish the cases $`m\le4`$, then explain why $`(\mathrm{FP}_m)`$ implies the critical-value budget in degree $`m+1`$.

<a id="the-three-point-mechanism."></a>

#### The three-point mechanism.

The one-point inequality is $`1-|c_1|^2\le1`$. For two points put $`a=|c_1|`$, $`b=|c_2|`$, and $`d=|1-\overline c_1c_2|\le1+ab`$. The square of the left side of $`(\mathrm{FP}_2)`$ is at most
``` math
2(1+ab)(2-a^2-b^2)\le4(1-a^2b^2)\le4,
```
by Cauchy–Schwarz and $`a^2+b^2\ge2ab`$.

For three points put $`x_i=1-|c_i|^2`$, $`d_{ij}=|1-\overline c_ic_j|`$, and
``` math
S=\sum_{i=1}^3(x_i d_{ij}d_{ik})^{1/3},\qquad
 Q=\sum_i|c_i|^2,\quad E_2=\sum_{i<j}|c_i|^2|c_j|^2,
 \quad s=\sum_i c_i,
```
where $`\{i,j,k\}=\{1,2,3\}`$ in each summand. Hölder and Cauchy–Schwarz give
``` math
S^3\le(3-Q)(d_{12}+d_{13}+d_{23})^2
 \le3(3-Q)(3+Q-|s|^2+E_2).
```
The last expression has an exact nonnegative defect:
``` math
(3-Q)(3+Q-|s|^2+E_2)=9-\Delta,
 \qquad
 \Delta=\frac12\sum_{i<j}(|c_i|^2-|c_j|^2)^2
          +QE_2+(3-Q)|s|^2\ge0.
```
Thus $`S\le3`$. Equality forces equal moduli and $`QE_2=0`$, hence all three points are zero; conversely the zero configuration attains equality. The bound comes from this defect identity, rather than from separately maximising the pairwise factors.

<a id="four-points-require-two-complementary-estimates."></a>

#### Four points require two complementary estimates.

For four points the inequality is again true, with equality only when all points are zero. Its proof divides at $`\max_j|c_j|^2=21/25`$. In the central region put
``` math
h_j=\frac14\log\prod_k|1-\overline c_jc_k|,
 \quad L_j=-\log(1-|c_j|^2),\quad
 E=\frac14\sum_{r\ge1}\frac{|\sum_kc_k^r|^2}{r}.
```
The convergent logarithmic expansion gives $`\sum_jh_j=-E`$ and $`\sum_jh_j^2\le E\,\frac14\sum_jL_j`$. Exact polynomial and Taylor estimates give $`h_j<11/50`$, $`\frac14\sum_jL_j<11/6`$, and $`\Phi(11/50)<6/11`$, where $`\Phi(t)=(e^t-1-t)/t^2`$ is increasing, with $`\Phi(0)=1/2`$. Consequently
``` math
\sum_je^{h_j}\le4-E+\Phi(11/50)\sum_jh_j^2<4
```
when $`E>0`$; when $`E=0`$, all power sums vanish and all four points are zero.

In the outer region put $`x_j=1-|c_j|^2`$ and
``` math
W=(\sum_jx_j)(d_{12}+d_{34})(d_{13}+d_{24})(d_{14}+d_{23}).
```
Hölder applied to the three perfect matchings of four vertices gives $`S_4^4\le8W`$. If $`a`$ is the largest squared radius and $`s`$ is the sum of the other three, Cauchy–Schwarz and AM–GM give
``` math
W\le(4-a-s)
 \left[\frac23\left(6+a+(1+a)s+\frac{s^2}{3}\right)\right]^{3/2}<32
 \qquad(a\ge21/25).
```
For the last inequality the right side decreases in $`a`$; at $`a=21/25`$ its maximum occurs at $`s=(-27+3\sqrt{473})/50`$ and is strictly below $`32`$. Thus $`S_4<4`$ in the outer region. The full polynomial, Taylor and radical certificates for these estimates are given in the public [four-point proof](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/research_corpus/Erdos1041/FreePointZeroInsertionFP4Matching.md); the preceding short defect proof is recorded in the [three-point proof](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/research_corpus/Erdos1041/FreePointMeanInequalityFP3.md).

<a id="from-free-points-to-critical-values."></a>

#### From free points to critical values.

Here is the all-degree implication. After translating and scaling the root disk to radius one, write $`f_a(z)=\prod_{i=1}^n(z-a_i)`$ and consider
``` math
\Psi(a_1,\ldots,a_n)=
 \sum_{f_a'(c)=0}|f_a(c)|^{1/n},
```
counting multiplicity. Away from multiple critical points, local critical branches and their values are holomorphic, so $`\Psi`$ is plurisubharmonic. The symmetric multiset sum is continuous across critical collisions and locally bounded above; the removable-singularity theorem extends its plurisubharmonicity across that analytic locus. Applying the subharmonic maximum principle successively in each root coordinate reduces its maximum to $`|a_i|=1`$ for every $`i`$.

On that torus, if $`f'(z)=n\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}(z-c_k)`$, then
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:critical-torus-product}
 |f(c_j)|=\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}|1-\overline{c_j}c_k|.
\end{equation}
```
Indeed, for a critical point $`c\ne0`$ that is not a root, conjugating $`\sum_i(c-a_i)^{-1}=0`$ gives $`\sum_i a_i/(1-\bar c a_i)=0`$, hence $`\sum_i(1-\bar c a_i)^{-1}=n`$. Thus $`|f'(1/\bar c)|=n|c|\,|f(1/\bar c)|`$. The product formulas and $`|f(1/\bar c)|=|c|^{-n}|f(c)|`$ give <a href="#eq:critical-torus-product" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:critical-torus-product">[eq:critical-torus-product]</a>. At $`c=0`$ both sides are one; if $`c`$ is also a root, it lies on the unit circle and both sides vanish. Gauss–Lucas puts all critical points in the closed disk, so $`(\mathrm{FP}_{n-1})`$ applies, including multiplicities.

Put $`m=n-1`$ and $`y_j=|f(c_j)|^{1/m}`$. The free-point inequality gives $`\sum_jy_j\le m`$. Concavity supplies exactly the exponent needed:
``` math
y^{m/(m+1)}\le\frac{my+1}{m+1}\quad(y\ge0),\qquad
 \sum_j|f(c_j)|^{1/n}\le m.
```
Scaling back multiplies the last sum by $`R`$, proving Theorem <a href="#res:critical-value-budget" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:critical-value-budget">11</a>. If $`R=0`$, all critical values vanish and the conclusion is immediate.

This is an ordinary proof. The public [torus reduction](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/research_corpus/Erdos1041/FreePointTorusPshReduction.md) and its Lean companion separate the scalar concavity step from the plurisubharmonic maximum principle and polynomial identity; the companion formalises the scalar step, not those analytic bridges. The four-point Lean companion likewise contains algebraic kernels, not the complete logarithmic and calculus proof. No full Lean formalisation of the critical-value budget is claimed here.

The budget guarantees a critical value at most $`R^n`$, but does not force the smaller quintic threshold $`1/M_5`$ below. On the unit radial family all critical values have modulus one, so a uniformly strict improvement is unavailable. Nor does the value budget bound inverse-ray lengths: a path selection or metric comparison is still needed.

<a id="the-degree-five-target-is-now-explicit"></a>

## The degree-five target is now explicit

The degree-five analysis sharpens the two-nearest-spoke threshold. If a critical point $`c`$ satisfies $`|f(c)|\le1/M_n`$, then both straight segments to the two nearest roots remain in $`\{|f|\le1\}`$ and their total length is at most $`2`$. The envelope is obtained by maximising the exact product along the second spoke; at degree five,
``` math
M_5=(1-t_*)(1+t_*)^3\sqrt{16t_*^2-4t_*+1},
 \qquad
 t_*={5\over16}+{3\sqrt{105}\over80},
 \qquad
 {1\over M_5}=0.2760461\ldots.
```
This is an 11-fold improvement over the earlier deep-low threshold, but it does not assert that every quintic has a critical value below this level.

The exact remaining degree-five statement is therefore not “improve the constant” but the following selection problem:

> For every monic quintic with roots in the closed unit disc, there is a critical point $`c`$ with $`|f(c)|\le1`$ and two roots $`a,b`$ such that $`|f|\le1`$ on $`[c,a]\cup[c,b]`$ and $`|c-a|+|c-b|\le2`$.

The public file calls this (SPOKE-5). Together with the existing two-segment reduction it would settle degree five, but (SPOKE-5) is not proved. Coverage experiments put the residual in rapid, nearly simultaneous merging near the regular pentagon: the generic sampled families were covered, whereas the surviving band has every named merge threshold active and $`D`$ near $`1`$. Those percentages locate the work; they are not a theorem.

At the same degree, the terminal connected component admits a sharper area identity. If $`K_t=\{|f|\le t\}`$ is connected and the centred exterior map is
``` math
\psi(\zeta)=t^{1/n}\zeta+a_0+
 \sum_{k\ge1}a_k\zeta^{-k},
```
then Grönwall’s identity gives
``` math
\operatorname{Area}(K_t)=\pi\left(t^{2/n}-
 \sum_{k\ge1}k|a_k|^2\right),
 \qquad
 a_1=-\frac{c_{n-2}}{n\,t^{1/n}}
 \quad\text{after centring}.
```
It replaces a Pólya upper bound at that terminal node, but extending it to proper components and connecting it to the parent theorem remains open. The degree-five statements and their evidence classes are recorded in [`Degree5AssemblyAndSharpenedCuts.md`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/f214a6b45528dc5eefe20ffadc35f2e981627d4c/research_corpus/Erdos1041/Degree5AssemblyAndSharpenedCuts.md).

<a id="the-no-go-boundaries-force-hub-selection"></a>

## The no-go boundaries force hub selection

The same frontier is useful because it closes off three misleading readings. First, the strict-argmin first-merge hub need not have two-arm length below $`2`$. A degree-five tie-locus witness, moved into the open unit disc, has
``` math
L(c_*)=2.0573432753\ldots>2,
```
with a 50-digit two-instrument reconstruction and a margin about 97 times that of the earlier degree-four witness. This is computational certificate evidence, not an exact rational theorem; the parent remains viable because a different hub at the same configuration supplies the relevant pair.

Second, the aggregate estimate $`\sum_cL(c)\le2(n-1)R`$ is refuted at degree four on an open violating region and at one degree-five witness. Its algebraic factor
``` math
\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}|f(c_k)|^{1/n}\le(n-1)R
```
is proved for $`n\le5`$ in Theorem <a href="#res:critical-value-budget" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:critical-value-budget">11</a> and remains conjectural in higher degrees. The metric factor is not automatic even in the proved degrees. These two boundaries, including the distinction between the surviving algebraic budget and the failed length aggregate, are in [`MinimalHubArmBudgetRefutation.md`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/f214a6b45528dc5eefe20ffadc35f2e981627d4c/research_corpus/Erdos1041/MinimalHubArmBudgetRefutation.md) and [`SeparatrixAggregateReduction.md`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/f214a6b45528dc5eefe20ffadc35f2e981627d4c/research_corpus/Erdos1041/SeparatrixAggregateReduction.md).

Third, the origin is not a uniform near-Fekete hub. An exact rational quintic with roots scaled by $`999999/1000000`$ has four of five origin spokes escaping $`\{|f|\le1\}`$ at explicit rational sample points, even though $`1-D=3.19991\cdot10^{-4}`$. Consequently no fixed $`\eta`$-neighbourhood of the Fekete locus can force two contained origin spokes in degree five. The mechanism is angular: the first several Fourier modes can point against different spokes. The certificate is exact for the displayed witness; the claim that the phenomenon persists throughout a limiting family is computational. The full witness and replay route are in [`NearFeketeRadialAngularSplit.md`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/f214a6b45528dc5eefe20ffadc35f2e981627d4c/research_corpus/Erdos1041/NearFeketeRadialAngularSplit.md).

<a id="the-surviving-carrier-and-the-actual-open-endpoint"></a>

## The surviving carrier and the actual open endpoint

These refutations leave a selector as the surviving carrier. On the ray-separated dense class, the public frontier records the canonical open row
``` math
\min_{c\ \mathrm{admissible}} L(c)\le2,
```
where admissibility includes the two inverse-ray arms being contained in the relevant lemniscate component. Its measured values remain below $`2`$ at the refuting configurations, and the existing attachment and lower semicontinuity reductions would turn this row into the parent theorem. No proof of the row is currently available. In particular, the nonzero hub that rescues the origin-spoke witnesses is evidence for the selector, not a universal construction.

The honest current endpoint is therefore a containment selector with three separate obligations: choose the hub, keep both arms inside the component, and control the metric fan-in. The Lean module cited elsewhere in this note checks the Newton value equation, ray-collision avoidance, and root-retention inputs; the new frontier files above are ordinary proof, exact-certificate, and computational research records, not formal authority for (SPOKE-5), the no-go generalisations, or the parent theorem. Keeping those authority boundaries visible is part of making the frontier reusable.

<a id="sec:newton"></a>

# The Newton value equation

Away from the critical set, define the complex Newton field
``` math
N(z)=-\frac{f(z)}{f'(z)} .
```
Let $`z(t)`$ be differentiable with $`z'(t)=N(z(t))`$, and put $`w(t)=f(z(t))`$.

<div id="res:value" class="theorem">

**Theorem 12** (value equation). *$`w'(t)=-w(t)`$.*

</div>

The computation is one line: $`w'=f'(z)\,z'=f'(z)\cdot(-f(z)/f'(z))=-f(z)=-w`$. The kernel checks it as *newton flow value has deriv at*, together with the differential form of the first integral, *newton flow scaled value has deriv at zero*:
``` math
\frac{d}{dt}\Bigl(e^{t}f(z(t))\Bigr)=0,
  \qquad\text{equivalently}\qquad
  f(z(t))=e^{-t}f(z(0)) .
```
Observe what this says about the geometry. The value moves radially inward at exponential rate and never changes argument. The lemniscate $`\{|f|<1\}`$ is therefore forward-invariant, and the flow lines are exactly the preimages of rays from the origin.

<div id="res:ray" class="corollary">

**Corollary 13** (ray separation). *The endpoints of any finite Newton-flow connection lie on the same oriented ray from $`0`$. Consequently, if two critical values lie on distinct positive rays, no Newton-flow saddle connection joins the corresponding critical points.*

</div>

This is checked in consumer form: the kernel accepts the implication from the hypothesis of distinct rays to the absence of a connection. It is the statement the topology needs, and it is a genuine sharpening of the criterion used in the literature.

<a id="sec:arguments"></a>

# Arguments, not moduli

It is tempting to arrange a generic perturbation so that the critical values are pairwise distinct, or that their moduli are pairwise distinct, and to conclude that saddle connections are excluded. Neither is enough.

Two distinct critical values can lie on one ray, and two critical values with distinct moduli certainly can: the ray records the argument, and the modulus is exactly the coordinate the flow contracts. By Corollary <a href="#res:ray" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:ray">13</a> the invariant that excludes connections is the argument. What a perturbation must therefore achieve is pairwise distinct critical-value *arguments*, which is a condition on $`n-1`$ points modulo the circle rather than on their positions in the plane.

The cost of that condition is also checked, and it is small.

<div id="res:locus" class="theorem">

**Theorem 14** (ray-collision locus). *Let $`a\ne b`$ be complex. Every common translation $`\beta`$ for which $`a+\beta`$ and $`b+\beta`$ lie on the same positive ray has the form
``` math
\beta=\frac{ra-b}{1-r},
  \qquad r\in\mathbb{R}_{>0},\ r\ne1 .
```*

</div>

So each pair of critical values contributes a one-real-parameter forbidden locus in the translation plane, given in closed form (*translated same positive ray parameterization*). A finite union of such loci has empty interior, which is the shape one wants for an avoidance argument. Turning that into a perturbation of $`f`$ is not immediate: the translation model must be replaced by an actual perturbation of the roots that keeps them inside $`\mathbb{D}`$ and preserves the length slack. That is the first open producer of §<a href="#sec:open" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:open">9</a>.

<a id="sec:gap"></a>

# A proof gap in the unrestricted argument

The March manuscript’s Proposition 12 claims the following load-bearing statement. For $`u=-\log|f|`$, a connected component $`V`$ of $`\{u>c\}`$ carrying $`m\ge2`$ simple zeros, and the stated regularity and Morse hypotheses, it constructs, for every $`\varepsilon>0`$, an embedded spanning tree $`G_\varepsilon\subset V`$ with
``` math
\operatorname{len}(G_\varepsilon)
 \le\frac1{2\pi}\int_{2\alpha}^{\infty}P_V(t)\,dt+\varepsilon.
\tag{5.1}\label{eq:prop12-bound}
```
The final theorem uses this estimate, so the issue below cannot be bypassed by calling the proposition auxiliary.

At an interior index-one critical point $`p`$, the proof invokes a Morse chart
``` math
u=\mu+x^2-y^2
```
and replaces the saddle by a three-ended neighbourhood having one connected lower cross-section and two connected upper cross-sections. That local model is false as written. Because $`p\in V`$ and $`V`$ is open, a sufficiently small closed disc around $`p`$ lies entirely in $`V`$. In that disc the full Morse chart has four sectors: two components of $`u>\mu`$ and two components of $`u<\mu`$. A global component argument cannot delete one local sector from a disc already contained in $`V`$.

This diagnoses a proof step, not the proposition’s statement. A repair might cut an adjoining regular annulus along a separatrix or regular flow arc before forming the block, retain a four-pronged saddle neighbourhood and change the assembly, or replace the local construction by the ray-cut decomposition proposed below. Any repair must prove that its connector cost can be made arbitrarily small uniformly in the attachment points and that the repaired blocks still assemble to an embedded tree satisfying <a href="#eq:prop12-bound" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:prop12-bound">[eq:prop12-bound]</a>. The shorter descriptions of the same three-ended block do not repair the four-sector topology.

Corollary <a href="#res:ray" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:ray">13</a> supplies one independent input for a different route: distinct critical-value arguments exclude saddle-to-saddle Newton connections. It does not itself prove the compact planar decomposition, classify all orbit endpoints or provide the metric gluing estimate. Those are separate problems below.

<a id="sec:finite"></a>

# Finite evidence

A search was run over random monic polynomials with roots in the unit disc. For each sample the region $`\{|f|<1\}`$ was rasterised and shortest grid paths were computed between every pair of roots. The best upper bounds obtained were
``` math
\begin{array}{lrr}
    \text{degree } 5, & 500 \text{ trials}: & 1.1052648928\\
    \text{degree } 6, & 1500 \text{ trials}: & 0.8450414343\\
    \text{degree } 8, & 1500 \text{ trials}: & 0.6203916714\\
    \text{degree } 10, & 1500 \text{ trials}: & 0.4303640486 .
  \end{array}
```
No counterexample candidate was found, and the measured values sit well below the threshold $`2`$. These are grid distances for the sampled configurations: upper bounds on those samples, not bounds over the family. The apparent decrease with degree is a property of the sample, and we draw no conjecture from it. Future searches should target named failure modes—near-degenerate saddles, thin necks, boundary-critical configurations and almost-connected separatrices—and report those diagnostics. Raster paths remain candidate finders, never continuous certificates.

# Complements and further questions

The dependency chain has five separate gates. A proof, a minimally corrected hypothesis set, or an explicit polynomial or planar counterexample is a decisive answer to any one of them.

The full-disc model $`x^2-y^2`$, an annulus in which lower branches rejoin, two saddles joined by a separatrix and simultaneous saddle levels are mandatory tests. Repeating the one-lower/two-upper assertion does not answer the problem.

<a id="the-compact-ray-cut-decomposition"></a>

## 2. The compact ray-cut decomposition

Let $`p`$ have simple roots, simple nonzero critical points and let $`u=-\log|p|`$. For regular values $`c<T`$, take
``` math
M_{c,T}=\overline{V\cap\{c<u<T\}},
```
and assume explicitly that this is a compact genus-zero surface, its lower boundary is one smooth Jordan curve, its upper boundary consists of $`m`$ smooth root curves, all interior critical points are nondegenerate index-one saddles, the normalised gradient field
``` math
X=\frac{\nabla u}{|\nabla u|^2}=-\frac{p}{p'}
```
is transverse to the level boundaries, and no maximal $`X`$-trajectory has two saddle endpoints.

**Problem 16** (finite strip decomposition after ray cuts). For every $`\eta>0`$, construct disjoint Morse neighbourhoods $`N_j`$ with $`\sum_j\operatorname{diam}N_j<\eta`$ and a finite set of complete separatrix or regular-flow cuts so that every component of the complement is flow-diffeomorphic to a rectangle

No particular formula such as $`2s+1`$ is presumed. Boundary tangencies, simultaneous levels, branch reunion through an annulus and non-Hausdorff orbit spaces must be handled rather than suppressed.

For a strip $`S`$, write

For the final strict inequality, use the actual collar slack

## 4. Coefficient perturbation and stability

The constant-translation stage is no longer open. Once a finite critical-value family is injective, Lean proves an arbitrarily small translation making every value nonzero and pairwise positive-ray separated (*exists small translation separating arguments*). It also proves the explicit root-retention estimate; a shift below $`\varepsilon`$ keeps all roots in the unit disc when
``` math
((n+1)\varepsilon)^{1/n}+\rho<1
```
(*constant perturbation roots in unit disk*). A constant translation cannot separate initially equal critical values.

<div id="prob:perturb1041" class="problem">

**Problem 18** (two-stage generic perturbation with slack). For fixed root discs, compact collar $`K`$, regular levels $`\alpha/2,\alpha,2\alpha,5\alpha/2`$ and collar slack $`q>0`$, prove that an arbitrarily small
``` math
g_{\lambda,\beta}(z)=f(z)+\lambda z+\beta
```
can be chosen so that:

1.  $`f+\lambda z`$ has simple relevant critical points and injective complex critical values;

2.  the checked constant translation $`\beta`$ makes those values nonzero and pairwise ray-separated;

3.  no critical point enters the protected collar or truncation boundary;

4.  the relevant component remains in $`K`$, contains exactly the corresponding perturbed roots and has slack $`q_g>q/2`$; and

5.  root displacement and straight-line transfer back to the original roots consume less than a prescribed fraction of $`q/m`$.

If the one-coefficient perturbation $`\lambda z`$ cannot ensure all five properties, give the smallest additional lower-coefficient direction that can, or an explicit obstruction.

</div>

Finite planar avoidance and the subsequent constant translation must not be relisted as missing; coefficient genericity, component stability and slack stability are the open content.

The checked algebra proves the pointwise value equation and the endpoint-ray consumer. It does not supply global solution theory or an orbit-space graph. A positive stronger theorem must give the graph and a finite edge bound; a negative answer should exhibit the simplest ray-separated polynomial carrying the remaining pathology.

Erdős #1041 remains open. The source now publicly verifies the Newton kernel, finite ray avoidance and quantitative constant-translation root control; the coefficient perturbation, corrected planar decomposition and metric gluing remain the exact unresolved producers.
