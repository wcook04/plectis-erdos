# Reciprocal Mersenne Subseries

<div class="center">

<span class="smallcaps">Abstract</span>

</div>

We prove a weighted summability criterion for the irrationality of reciprocal Mersenne subseries. For an integer base $`b\ge2`$ and a finite nonempty prime set $`\mathcal P`$, let $`h(a)=\prod_{p\in\mathcal P}p^{v_p(a)}`$ be the part of $`a`$ supported on these primes. Every infinite set $`A\subseteq\mathbb{N}_{>0}`$ satisfying
``` math
\sum_{a\in A}\frac{h(a)}{a(b^{h(a)}-1)}<\infty
```
has irrational $`\sum_{a\in A}(b^a-1)^{-1}`$. The base-two condition gives the conclusion at every integer base for every infinite subset of $`A`$, and it permits an explicit example with divergent reciprocal sum. The condition nevertheless excludes full support and the set of all odd exponents. The proof averages over multiples of a modulus divisible by a prescribed finite part of the support. A second average over dyadic observation lengths controls the errors from incomplete periods. Erdős already stated the weaker reciprocal-summable theorem without the coprimality restriction; its complete ordinary proof is also printed here. A finite estimate uniform in the moving modulus lets the weighted and positive-cover arguments share one observation window. This proves irrationality at every integer base for every infinite subset of the union of two sets satisfying the respective criteria.

We also give finite-denominator and achievement-set calculations, and formulate explicit conditional tests for the targets $`1/2`$ and $`1/21`$. These tests do not decide either target or the universal question. The classical full-support, periodic-support and strict-tail results used for comparison are attributed in the text. Existing work settles prime support at base $`2`$ and squarefree support at every power-of-two base; those cases are not claimed as new.

### How to read this document

Section 1 proves the support criteria and compares them with the literature. Sections 5–8 develop the finite arithmetic used in the rational-membership tests. Sections 9–12 distinguish the hypotheses of conditional implications from the finite evidence for them. Section 13 proves the arithmetic-sampling counterexample cited in the short paper. The global notation below is supplemented by definitions where each specialised recurrence is used.

A sufficient condition need not be necessary; an equivalent condition does not prove either side. Counterexamples concern the specified estimate, and a finite computation establishes only its stated range.

*Formal proofs.* A result with a kernel-checked Lean proof carries a mark in the margin. *Lean* opens the proof: the declaration itself when one declaration states the whole result, otherwise the list of declarations that together state it. *Comparator* opens the record of an independent check, in which the same statement, written again from Mathlib alone in a separate repository, was compared with our proof by Lean’s Comparator tool, allowing only the three standard axioms. A dagger on the Lean mark means that the Lean proof assumes an input named just below the result. A result without a mark has no Lean proof of its whole statement; what is checked is said below it. The [evidence record](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/c75e491ca57b70ba3a2b5a418c7acd49a53d8dfe/evidence/erdos257-mersenne-reasoning-surface.md) gives every declaration, version and check. These checks show that the stated propositions are proved; whether they are the right propositions is a question the reader can settle by comparing them with the text.

A link marked <span class="smallcaps">Lean source</span> beside an observation or a proof step opens the declaration for that step. Such links are for checking precise definitions; they are not additional hypotheses. A finite computation is described as one where it is used: a result at specified values or below a bound is not a result at arbitrarily large values. Neither the universal problem nor either rational-target question is resolved in this paper.

#### Notation used throughout

For $`A\subseteq\mathbb N_{>0}`$ and an integer $`b\ge2`$, put
``` math
X_A(b)=\sum_{a\in A}\frac1{b^a-1},\qquad
 c_A(n)=\#\{a\in A:a\mid n\}\quad(n\ge1).
```
At base two write $`w_n=(2^n-1)^{-1}`$, $`R_n=\sum_{j>n}w_j`$ and $`\mathcal A=\{X_A(2):A\subseteq\mathbb N_{>0}\}`$. For $`x\ge0`$ the real greedy remainder is defined by $`r_0(x)=x`$ and
``` math
r_n(x)=r_{n-1}(x)-\begin{cases}
 w_n,&w_n\le r_{n-1}(x),\\
 0,&w_n>r_{n-1}(x).
 \end{cases}
```
The greedy support $`G_x`$ consists of the selected indices; $`G=G_{1/2}`$. For the half target index $`1`$ is skipped. Thus a recurrence begun at index $`2`$ with remainder $`1/2`$ is the same process, with its index shifted.

The finite quotient arguments use
``` math
q(M,d)=\left\lfloor\frac{2^M}{2^d-1}\right\rfloor,\qquad
 Q(D,M)=\sum_{d\in D}q(M,d).
```
For $`M\ge k`$ their nonnegative binary remainder and signed next-step expression are
``` math
\begin{aligned}
 S(D,k,M)&=\max\{2^{M-k}-Q(D,M)-1,0\},\\
 H(D,k,n)&=2S(D,k,n-1)+1-c_D(n)\quad(n>k).
 \end{aligned}
```
The maximum matters: subtraction in the corresponding natural-number source definition is truncated at zero. Statements that remove the maximum establish nonnegativity first.

The integer carry for a support omitting $`1`$ is
``` math
\operatorname{ihc}(A,N)=2^N-
 \sum_{j=2}^{N+1}2^{N+1-j}c_A(j),\qquad
 C_A(N)=\operatorname{ihc}(A,N)-1.
```
Some finite-depth statements use $`K_A(m)=\operatorname{ihc}(A,m-1)`$. The recurring bound $`B(m)=2\lfloor\sqrt m\rfloor+4`$ is integral; bounds written with $`\sqrt m`$ rather than its floor are real-valued bounds. Quantities specific to one argument are defined in that argument. Some formal sources allow a support to be a subset of $`\mathbb{N}`$, including zero. In all reciprocal sums in this paper only positive exponents contribute: for such a support, $`X_A(b)`$ means $`X_{A\cap\mathbb{N}_{>0}}(b)`$. The expression $`1/(b^0-1)`$ is never evaluated.

#### Reciprocal-summable supports

For every infinite set $`A`$ of positive integers with $`\sum_{a\in A}1/a<\infty`$, the series
``` math
X_A(b)=\sum_{a\in A}\frac1{b^a-1}
```
is irrational at every integer base $`b\ge2`$. The proof below is ordinary mathematics and is the proof of the short paper’s Theorem 1.2. Erdős’s [1968 paper, p. 222](https://users.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1969-09.pdf) proves the pairwise-coprime case at every integer base and states the removal of coprimality without printing the details. The proof below gives the stated extension by averaging; no comparison with the omitted proof is possible. The linked pairwise-coprime theorem retains that extra hypothesis. The same paper says that $`\sum1/n_i<\infty`$ could be replaced by a weaker but more complicated condition (p. 222), and suggests that for pairwise coprime supports Brun’s method could probably replace it by $`\sum_{n_i<x}1/n_i=o(\log\log x)`$ (p. 226). Theorem <a href="#thm:257-weighted" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:257-weighted">1</a> below proves irrationality under one explicit weaker condition without coprimality; no identification with his suggestions is asserted.

The mechanism is to make positive displacements arbitrarily small. For $`N>0`$, write $`N=q_a a+r_a`$, $`0\le r_a<a`$. The identity
``` math
\frac{b^N-1}{b^a-1}
 =b^{r_a}\sum_{j=0}^{q_a-1}b^{ja}
  +\frac{b^{r_a}-1}{b^a-1}
```
shows that
``` math
\Delta_{b,A}(N):=\sum_{a\in A}\frac{b^{N\bmod a}-1}{b^a-1}
 =(b^N-1)X_A(b)-J_N,\qquad J_N\in\mathbb Z.
```
The integer sum is finite, since $`q_a=0`$ for $`a>N`$. Every summand of $`\Delta_{b,A}(N)`$ is nonnegative and an exponent $`a>N`$ makes it positive. Thus $`X_A(b)=p/q`$ would imply $`\Delta_{b,A}(N)\ge1/q`$ for every $`N>0`$.

Put $`w_{b,d}(N)=b^{N\bmod d}/(b^d-1)`$. For a fixed positive modulus $`Q`$ and $`g=(Q,d)`$, the orbit of $`Qm\bmod d`$ has length $`d/g`$. Its geometric sum gives
``` math
\lim_{X\to\infty}\frac1X\sum_{m=1}^Xw_{b,d}(Qm)
 =M_{Q,b}(d):=\frac{g}{d(b^g-1)}\le\frac1d.
```
The important interchange is with the infinite support. Expanding the atom as $`\sum_{r\ge1}b^{-r}{\bf1}_{d\mid Qm+r}`$ and counting positive multiples of $`d`$ gives the bound
``` math
\frac1X\sum_{m=1}^Xw_{b,d}(Qm)
 \le\sum_{r\ge1}b^{-r}\frac{Q+r}{d}
 \le\frac{Q+2}{d}.
```
Here $`Q`$ is fixed. Dominated convergence therefore identifies the limiting mean of $`\sum_{d\in A}w_{b,d}(Qm)`$ with $`\sum_{d\in A}M_{Q,b}(d)`$.

Now choose $`Q_t=\operatorname{lcm}(1,\ldots,t)`$. For each fixed $`d`$, eventually $`d\mid Q_t`$, so $`M_{Q_t,b}(d)=(b^d-1)^{-1}`$. The bound $`M_{Q_t,b}(d)\le1/d`$ permits a second dominated-convergence argument:
``` math
\sum_{d\in A}M_{Q_t,b}(d)\longrightarrow X_A(b).
```
Consequently the limiting mean of $`\Delta_{b,A}(Q_tm)`$ tends to zero. Given $`\varepsilon>0`$, first choose $`t`$ and then a sufficiently long finite average with mean below $`\varepsilon`$; one term of that average is below $`\varepsilon`$. Its strict positivity contradicts the rational lattice. This proves the assertion. The exact all-base statement, with hypotheses $`b\ge2`$, infinitude of $`A`$, and summability of $`a\mapsto\mathbf1_A(a)/a`$, has a [kernel-checked Lean proof](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/065e09523286894dfb57ba205e69666843817009/lean/Erdos249257/AllBaseReciprocalSupportIrrationality.lean#L395).

The order of the two limits matters: the observation length increases with $`Q_t`$ fixed before $`t`$ increases. No independence of different divisibility events is assumed. The mechanism also has a definite limit. At base two and full support, the contribution of exponents $`a>N`$ alone gives $`\Delta_{2,\mathbb N_{>0}}(N)>1-2^{-N}\ge1/2`$. Full-support irrationality therefore uses a different argument; its checked form appears below.

<a id="a-weighted-condition-on-the-support"></a>

#### A weighted condition on the support

The reciprocal-summable case is a useful model, but powers of a fixed prime can make an exponent cheaper than its reciprocal suggests. For example, with $`a=2^km`$ and $`m`$ odd, the weight below becomes $`1/[m(b^{2^k}-1)]`$. The exponential denominator permits a large collection of odd factors at large $`k`$.

**Theorem 1** (A weighted summability criterion). *Let $`b\ge2`$ be an integer, let $`\mathcal P`$ be a finite nonempty set of primes, and let $`A\subseteq\mathbb N_{>0}`$ be infinite. Write
``` math
h(a)=\prod_{p\in\mathcal P}p^{v_p(a)},
```
where $`v_p(a)`$ is the exponent of $`p`$ in $`a`$; thus $`h(a)`$ is the $`\mathcal P`$-part of $`a`$. If
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:257-weighted-mass}
 W_{b,\mathcal P}(A):=
 \sum_{a\in A}\frac{h(a)}{a\bigl(b^{h(a)}-1\bigr)}<\infty,
\end{equation}
```
then
``` math
X_A(b)=\sum_{a\in A}\frac1{b^a-1}
```
is irrational. More precisely, for
``` math
\Delta_{b,A}(m)=
 \sum_{a\in A}\frac{b^{m\bmod a}-1}{b^a-1},
```
for every $`\varepsilon>0`$ and every $`N`$ there is an $`m\ge N`$ with $`0<\Delta_{b,A}(m)<\varepsilon`$.*

###### Examples and limits of the hypothesis.

Squares, powers of two and factorials satisfy reciprocal summability and therefore satisfy the base-two weighted condition. Full support does not: for any fixed finite prime set $`P`$, its subset coprime to $`\prod_{p\in P}p`$ has weight $`1/[a(b-1)]`$ and divergent reciprocal sum. The set of all odd exponents also fails, by restricting to integers coprime to $`2\prod_{p\in P}p`$. Inclusion–exclusion in the harmonic sum proves both divergences. This is a limitation of the sufficient condition, not an argument for rationality; full support is already known to be irrational.

Writing $`a=hm`$ with $`h`$ its $`\mathcal P`$-part gives the exact decomposition
``` math
W_{b,\mathcal P}(A)=\sum_{h\in\mathcal H_{\mathcal P}}\frac1{b^h-1}
       \sum_{\substack{m\ge1,\ hm\in A\\(m,\prod_{p\in\mathcal P}p)=1}}\frac1m,
```
where $`\mathcal H_{\mathcal P}`$ consists of $`1`$ and the positive integers with no prime factor outside $`\mathcal P`$. Each inner reciprocal sum must be finite; the displayed outer sum imposes the additional summability across different $`\mathcal P`$-parts. For example, at base two with $`\mathcal P=\{2\}`$, choose in each layer $`2^k`$, $`k\ge1`$, a finite set of odd factors whose reciprocal sum is at least $`2^{2^k}`$. Every inner sum is finite, but the outer weighted sum diverges. Such finite sets exist by divergence of the harmonic sum over odd integers. Prime support also fails this criterion for every finite $`\mathcal P`$: its contribution from primes outside $`\mathcal P`$ is a constant multiple of their divergent reciprocal sum. These failures concern the sufficient hypothesis, not rationality of the resulting values. The following construction shows, nonetheless, that this condition is strictly weaker than reciprocal summability. At base two take
``` math
A_\star=\{2^k m:k\ge1,\ m\text{ odd},\ m\le2^{2^k}\}.
```
Write $`H_N=\sum_{m=1}^N1/m`$ and $`N_k=2^{2^k}`$. The reciprocal mass of the $`k`$th layer is
``` math
\rho_k=2^{-k}\!\sum_{\substack{m\le N_k\\m\text{ odd}}}\frac1m
 =2^{-k}\bigl(H_{N_k}-\tfrac12H_{N_k/2}\bigr)
 \longrightarrow\frac{\log2}{2}.
```
Thus $`\sum_{a\in A_\star}1/a`$ diverges. For $`\mathcal P=\{2\}`$, the weighted contribution of the same layer is
``` math
\frac{2^k}{2^{2^k}-1}\rho_k.
```
Since $`H_N\le1+\log N`$, these terms are at most $`(1+2^k\log2)2^{1-2^k}`$, which is summable. The theorem therefore proves irrationality at every integer base for every infinite subset of this set, although its reciprocal sum diverges.

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* We first record the rational obstruction and three finite estimates used to defeat it. If $`m=qa+r`$, $`0\le r<a`$, then
``` math
\frac{b^m-1}{b^a-1}-\frac{b^r-1}{b^a-1}
   =\sum_{j=1}^{q}b^{m-ja}.
```
Consequently
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:257-weighted-lattice}
 \Delta_{b,A}(m)=(b^m-1)X_A(b)-J_{b,A}(m),
 \qquad
 J_{b,A}(m)=
 \sum_{\substack{a\in A\\a\le m}}
 \sum_{j=1}^{\lfloor m/a\rfloor}b^{m-ja}\in\mathbb Z.
\end{equation}
```
The integer sum is finite. For $`m\ge1`$, moreover, $`\Delta_{b,A}(m)>0`$: since $`A`$ is infinite, some $`a\in A`$ exceeds $`m`$, and its summand is positive. At $`m=0`$ the displacement is zero. Thus, if $`X_A(b)=u/v`$ with $`v>0`$, equation <a href="#eq:257-weighted-lattice" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-lattice">[eq:257-weighted-lattice]</a> gives $`v\Delta_{b,A}(m)\in\mathbb Z`$, whence
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:257-weighted-gap}
 \Delta_{b,A}(m)\ge \frac1v\qquad(m\ge1).
\end{equation}
```
It is therefore enough to construct arbitrarily small positive displacements.

Put
``` math
\phi_a(m)=\frac{b^{m\bmod a}}{b^a-1},
 \qquad
 d_a(m)=\phi_a(m)-\frac1{b^a-1}.
```
Then $`d_a(m)\ge0`$ and $`\Delta_{b,A}(m)=\sum_{a\in A}d_a(m)`$. For $`Q,a,T\ge1`$, put $`g=(Q,a)`$. The residues $`tQ\bmod a`$ have period $`a/g`$ and visit $`0,g,\ldots,a-g`$ once in a period, so
``` math
\sum_{t=1}^{a/g}\phi_a(tQ)
 =\frac{1+b^g+\cdots+b^{a-g}}{b^a-1}
 =\frac1{b^g-1}.
```
Complete periods and at most one incomplete period therefore give
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:257-weighted-gcd-average}
 \frac1T\sum_{t=1}^{T}d_a(tQ)
 \le \frac{g}{a(b^g-1)}+\frac1{T(b^g-1)}.
\end{equation}
```
We shall also use that $`n/(b^n-1)`$ decreases for positive integers $`n`$; indeed
``` math
n(b^{n+1}-1)-(n+1)(b^n-1)
 =b^n\bigl(n(b-1)-1\bigr)+1>0.
```

The part of the support beyond the observation range has a uniform bound. If $`Y=QT`$ and $`a>Y\ge tQ`$, then $`tQ\bmod a=tQ`$ and $`d_a(tQ)\le2\,2^{tQ-a}`$. Hence
``` math
\sum_{a>Y}d_a(tQ)\le2\,2^{tQ-Y},
 \qquad
 \sum_{t=1}^{T}2^{tQ-Y}
 =\sum_{j=0}^{T-1}2^{-jQ}\le2,
```
and therefore
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:257-weighted-outer}
 \frac1T\sum_{t=1}^{T}
 \sum_{\substack{a\in A\\a>QT}}d_a(tQ)\le\frac4T.
\end{equation}
```

Finally, let $`\alpha_a\ge0`$ with $`\sum_a\alpha_a/a<\infty`$. For $`Q,M\ge1`$, finite rearrangement and a geometric sum give
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:257-weighted-dyadic-average}
 \sum_{j=M}^{2M-1}\frac1{2^j}
       \sum_{a\le Q2^j}\alpha_a
 \le 2Q\sum_{a\ge1}\frac{\alpha_a}{a}.
\end{equation}
```
Indeed, for each fixed $`a`$ the admissible indices satisfy $`2^j\ge a/Q`$ and
``` math
\sum_{\substack{M\le j<2M\\a\le Q2^j}}2^{-j}\le\frac{2Q}{a}.
```
Only finitely many terms occur on the left, so no infinite interchange is hidden here.

We now choose the modulus and the observation lengths. Fix $`\varepsilon>0`$ and a lower bound $`N`$. Select a finite $`F\subseteq A`$ such that
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:257-weighted-tail-choice}
 \sum_{a\in A\mathbin{\backslash} F}
 \frac{h(a)}{a(b^{h(a)}-1)}<\varepsilon,
\end{equation}
```
and put $`L=\operatorname{lcm}(F)`$, with $`L=1`$ if $`F`$ is empty. Write $`p_*=\max\mathcal P`$ and $`r=|\mathcal P|`$. For a large integer $`H\ge2p_*`$, set
``` math
Q_0(H)=\prod_{p\in\mathcal P}p^{\lfloor\log_pH\rfloor},
 \qquad Q=LQ_0(H),
 \qquad G=\left\lfloor\frac H{p_*}\right\rfloor.
```
Then $`Q\le LH^r`$, $`G\ge1`$, and every $`a\in F`$ divides $`Q`$, so its $`d_a(tQ)`$ contribution vanishes.

Consider first $`a\in A\mathbin{\backslash} F`$ with $`a\le QT`$ and $`h(a)\le H`$. Every prime-power factor of $`h(a)`$ occurs in $`Q_0(H)`$, hence $`h(a)\mid Q_0(H)`$ and $`(Q,a)\ge h(a)`$. Applying <a href="#eq:257-weighted-gcd-average" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-gcd-average">[eq:257-weighted-gcd-average]</a> and the monotonicity above, the total contribution of these $`a`$ is at most
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:257-weighted-small-part}
 \varepsilon+
 \frac1T\sum_{\substack{a\in A, a\le QT\\h(a)\le H}}
 \frac1{b^{h(a)}-1}.
\end{equation}
```
The first term is bounded using <a href="#eq:257-weighted-tail-choice" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-tail-choice">[eq:257-weighted-tail-choice]</a>.

For $`h(a)>H`$, one has $`(Q,a)\ge G`$. If every $`\mathcal P`$-prime-power component of $`h(a)`$ is at most $`H`$, then $`h(a)\mid Q_0(H)`$ and the gcd is larger than $`H`$. Otherwise some $`p^{v_p(a)}>H`$, and the gcd contains $`p^{\lfloor\log_pH\rfloor}>H/p\ge H/p_*`$. Thus <a href="#eq:257-weighted-gcd-average" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-gcd-average">[eq:257-weighted-gcd-average]</a>, enlarged from the support to all $`a\le QT`$, bounds the large-$`h(a)`$ part by
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:257-weighted-large-part}
 \frac{G(1+\log(QT))+Q}{b^G-1};
\end{equation}
```
we used $`\sum_{a\le QT}a^{-1}\le1+\log(QT)`$ and $`\#\{a\le QT\}/T=Q`$.

Let
``` math
\mathcal M(Q,T)=\frac1T\sum_{t=1}^{T}\Delta_{b,A}(tQ).
```
Combining <a href="#eq:257-weighted-outer" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-outer">[eq:257-weighted-outer]</a>, <a href="#eq:257-weighted-small-part" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-small-part">[eq:257-weighted-small-part]</a>, and <a href="#eq:257-weighted-large-part" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-large-part">[eq:257-weighted-large-part]</a> gives
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:257-weighted-master-average}
 \mathcal M(Q,T)\le
 \varepsilon+
 \frac1T\sum_{\substack{a\in A, a\le QT\\h(a)\le H}}
       \frac1{b^{h(a)}-1}
 +\frac{G(1+\log(QT))+Q}{b^G-1}+\frac4T.
\end{equation}
```
After the second average, the competing errors will be of orders $`Q/M`$ and $`GM/b^G`$. With $`L`$ fixed, $`Q`$ grows polynomially in $`H`$ and $`G`$ grows linearly, so an intermediate exponential scale makes both errors tend to zero. Choose
``` math
M=\left\lfloor b^{G/2}\right\rfloor
```
and average <a href="#eq:257-weighted-master-average" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-master-average">[eq:257-weighted-master-average]</a> over $`T=2^j`$, $`M\le j<2M`$. Apply <a href="#eq:257-weighted-dyadic-average" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-dyadic-average">[eq:257-weighted-dyadic-average]</a> with $`\alpha_a={\bf1}_A(a)/(b^{h(a)}-1)`$. Its hypothesis holds because
``` math
\sum_a\frac{\alpha_a}{a}
 =\sum_{a\in A}\frac1{a(b^{h(a)}-1)}
 \le W_{b,\mathcal P}(A).
```
We obtain the explicit finite diagonal estimate
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:257-weighted-final-diagonal}
 \frac1M\sum_{j=M}^{2M-1}\mathcal M(Q,2^j)
 \le \varepsilon+\frac{2QW_{b,\mathcal P}(A)}M
 +\frac{G(1+\log Q+2M\log2)+Q}{b^G-1}
 +4\,2^{-M}.
\end{equation}
```

As $`H\to\infty`$,
``` math
Q\le LH^r,\qquad G=H/p_*+O(1),\qquad M\asymp b^{G/2}.
```
Consequently $`Q/M\to0`$, $`GM/b^G\to0`$, $`(G\log Q+Q)/b^G\to0`$, and $`2^{-M}\to0`$. For sufficiently large $`H`$, we may also arrange $`Q\ge N`$ and make the right side of <a href="#eq:257-weighted-final-diagonal" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-final-diagonal">[eq:257-weighted-final-diagonal]</a> smaller than $`2\varepsilon`$. The left side is a finite average of positive numbers $`\Delta_{b,A}(tQ)`$. One of them therefore satisfies
``` math
0<\Delta_{b,A}(tQ)<2\varepsilon,
 \qquad tQ\ge Q\ge N.
```
The construction is valid for every positive $`\varepsilon`$; applying it with $`\varepsilon/2`$ proves the stated cofinal bound with $`\Delta_{b,A}(m)<\varepsilon`$. This contradicts <a href="#eq:257-weighted-gap" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-gap">[eq:257-weighted-gap]</a> if $`X_A(b)`$ is rational. ◻

</div>

Since $`b^{h(a)}-1\ge2^{h(a)}-1`$ for every $`b\ge2`$, one has $`W_{b,\mathcal P}(A)\le W_{2,\mathcal P}(A)`$. Thus the base-two weighted hypothesis gives the conclusion simultaneously at every integer base. The hypothesis is also hereditary under passage to infinite subsets. The theorem does not cover all infinite supports and gives no quantitative irrationality measure; no priority is claimed for it.

###### Averaging antecedents.

Both averaging proofs in this section end by choosing a term no larger than a finite mean. [Duverney and Tachiya](https://danielduverney.fr/documents/theorie-des-nombres/DuverneyTachiya190522.pdf) choose their index in the same way in their refinement of the Chowla–Erdős method: they average a local coefficient mass over an arithmetic progression built by the Chinese remainder theorem, and a term attaining the minimum supplies the bounds that control the tail beyond it (Section 2, (2.3)–(2.9), pp. 5–6 of the author preprint). [Kaneko, Suzuki and Tachiya](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20743) measure the average decay of scaled tails by $`R_c(q,x,z)`$, their (1.7) on p. 3 of arXiv v1. Under a counting condition on the support and a bound on $`R_c`$, most scaled tails in a range are small, and arbitrarily small nonzero scaled tails give irrationality (Lemmas 1 and 2, pp. 6–8). The divisor-incidence coefficients $`\#\{a\in A:a\mid n\}`$ are positive on every multiple of $`\min A`$. For any splitting into two sequences the two coefficient supports therefore cover a set of positive lower density, which is incompatible with the support-counting conditions \[kanekosuzukitachiya, Theorem 1(iii), p. 3, and Theorem 3(iv), p. 5\] requiring both counts to be $`o(x_n/z_n)`$ with $`z_n\ge1`$. Their remote-tail quantity $`R_c(q,x,z)`$ sums only offsets $`j\ge z`$, whereas the full scaled tail
``` math
\sum_{r\ge1}\frac{\#\{a\in A:a\mid m+r\}}{b^r}
 =\sum_{a\in A}\phi_a(m)=X_A(b)+\Delta_{b,A}(m)
```
is at least $`X_A(b)`$, which gives no lower bound for $`R_c`$. The proofs above average the displacement instead, along multiples of a modulus that freezes a finite part of $`A`$; the weighted proof adds the dyadic average <a href="#eq:257-weighted-dyadic-average" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-dyadic-average">[eq:257-weighted-dyadic-average]</a>.

<a id="sec:257-common-kernel"></a>

#### A finite estimate on common observation scales

For $`1<B\le2`$, positive integers $`L,d,M`$, and an integer $`R\ge0`$, put
``` math
w_{B,d}(n)=\frac{B^{n\bmod d}}{B^d-1},\qquad
 \mathscr D_{L;R,M}F
 =\frac1M\sum_{j=R}^{R+M-1}\frac1{2^j}
      \sum_{m=1}^{2^j}F(Lm).
```
The finite estimate
``` math
\begin{equation}
 \mathscr D_{L;R,M}w_{B,d}
 \le\frac{1+4L/M}{d(B-1)}
 \label{eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel}
\end{equation}
```
equivalently bounds $`(B-1)\mathscr D_{L;R,M}w_{B,d}`$ by $`(1+4L/M)/d`$. This normalized bound is uniform as $`B\downarrow1`$; the unnormalized right side grows like $`(B-1)^{-1}`$. The ratio $`L/M`$ measures the cost of incomplete modular periods.

To prove it, fix $`T=2^j`$ and average over $`1\le m\le T`$. When $`d\le LT`$, the complete orbit has length $`d/g`$, with $`g=(L,d)`$, and total weight $`1/(B^g-1)`$. Complete cycles and one remaining piece give
``` math
\frac1T\sum_{m=1}^T w_{B,d}(Lm)
 \le\frac{g}{d(B^g-1)}+\frac1{T(B^g-1)}
 \le\frac1{d(B-1)}+\frac1{T(B-1)}.
```
Across dyadic lengths satisfying $`d\le L2^j`$, the reciprocal-length errors sum to at most $`2L/[d(B-1)]`$. When $`d>2LT`$, there is no wrap and $`2Lm\le d-1`$; hence $`\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}B^i\ge dB^{(d-1)/2}\ge dB^{Lm}`$. Each atom is then at most $`1/[d(B-1)]`$. Finally, at most one dyadic length satisfies $`LT<d\le2LT`$. For that length the geometric sum and convexity give
``` math
\frac1T\sum_{m=1}^T w_{B,d}(Lm)
 =\frac{B^L}{T(B^L-1)}\frac{B^{LT}-1}{B^d-1}
 \le\frac{LB^L}{d(B^L-1)}
 \le\frac{2L}{d(B-1)}.
```
Summing the main terms and these two error budgets proves <a href="#eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel">[eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel]</a>. The argument displayed here is an ordinary proof. Lean sources exist for [the full estimate](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos-lean/blob/52f29ad173b04e3bac941b3663f2b9aebe5de0bb/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/PaperCompleteR8/DyadicKernel.lean#L207) and for [its complete-period and no-wrap ingredients](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos-lean/blob/52f29ad173b04e3bac941b3663f2b9aebe5de0bb/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/PaperCompleteR7/CoverKernel.lean#L130); no new compilation of them is claimed here. Nonnegative interchange permits summation against any coefficients $`c_d`$ with $`\sum_dc_d/d<\infty`$.

#### Positive divisor majorants

For a finite set $`F\subseteq\mathbb{N}_{>0}`$, put $`f_F(n)=\#\{a\in F:a\mid n\}`$. The next theorem bounds a fractional power of this count by a nonnegative sum over divisors.

**Theorem 2** (A summable family of divisor majorants). *For each $`j\ge1`$, let $`F_j\subseteq\mathbb{N}_{>0}`$ be finite, let $`0<\alpha_j\le1`$, and let $`c_{j,d}\ge0`$ satisfy
``` math
f_{F_j}(n)^{\alpha_j}\le\sum_{d\mid n}c_{j,d}\quad(n\ge1).
```
Set $`C_j=\sum_{d\ge1}c_{j,d}/d`$. If
``` math
\begin{equation}
 \sum_{j\ge1}\frac{C_j2^{j\alpha_j}}{2^{\alpha_j}-1}<\infty,
 \label{eq:257-strengthened-cover}
\end{equation}
```
then $`X_A(b)`$ is irrational for every infinite $`A\subseteq\bigcup_jF_j`$ and every integer $`b\ge2`$.*

</div>

Every finite set admits such a majorant: take $`\alpha_j=1`$ and $`c_{j,d}=\mathbf1_{F_j}(d)`$. The restrictive part is summability over the whole family, not the existence of a majorant for an individual set. For example, $`F_j=\{4^j\}`$ with these choices contributes $`2^{-j}`$ to <a href="#eq:257-strengthened-cover" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-strengthened-cover">[eq:257-strengthened-cover]</a>, so the theorem applies. Full support cannot admit a cover satisfying the theorem, because the proof gives arbitrarily small positive displacements and the full-support displacement is at least $`1/2`$.

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Write $`B_j=2^{\alpha_j}`$ and
``` math
U_j(N)=\sum_{r\ge1}2^{-r}f_{F_j}(N+r),\qquad
 V_j(N)=\sum_{d\ge1}c_{j,d}w_{B_j,d}(N).
```
The choice $`B_j=2^{\alpha_j}`$ matches the decay after taking a fractional power. Subadditivity and the divisor majorant give
``` math
U_j(N)^{\alpha_j}
 \le\sum_{r\ge1}B_j^{-r}f_{F_j}(N+r)^{\alpha_j}
 \le\sum_{d\ge1}c_{j,d}
       \sum_{\substack{r\ge1\\d\mid N+r}}B_j^{-r}
 =V_j(N).
```
The last identity sums a geometric progression in each residue class. The geometric-series identity also gives
``` math
\Delta_{2,F_j}(N)=U_j(N)-X_{F_j}(2)\le U_j(N).
```
Consequently, once the first $`J`$ covering sets have zero displacement, nonnegativity bounds the displacement of their union by $`\sum_{j>J}U_j(N)`$.

Fix $`\varepsilon>0`$, set $`t_j=\varepsilon2^{-j}`$, and choose $`J`$ with
``` math
K_J:=\sum_{j>J}\frac{C_jt_j^{-\alpha_j}}{B_j-1}<\frac14.
```
This is possible since $`\varepsilon^{-\alpha_j}\le\max(1,\varepsilon^{-1})`$. Choose $`L`$ divisible by every member of the first $`J`$ covering sets. Equation <a href="#eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel">[eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel]</a> bounds the finite mean of $`S_J(N):=\sum_{j>J}t_j^{-\alpha_j}V_j(N)`$ by $`(1+4L/M)K_J<1/2`$ whenever $`M\ge4L`$. One sample therefore has $`S_J(N)<1`$, forcing $`U_j(N)<t_j`$ for every $`j>J`$. Every exponent in the first $`J`$ finite sets divides $`L`$, so those terms have zero displacement. Consequently,
``` math
0<\Delta_{2,A}(N)\le\sum_{j>J}U_j(N)\le\varepsilon.
```
The fixed rational lattice excludes rationality at base two. For $`0\le r<d`$, the atom $`(b^r-1)/(b^d-1)`$ is nonincreasing in $`b>1`$. For $`r>0`$, cancellation of $`b-1`$ writes it as $`A(b)/(A(b)+C(b))`$, with $`A(b)=\sum_{i<r}b^i`$ and $`C(b)=\sum_{r\le j<d}b^j`$. Its derivative has the sign of $`A'C-AC'=\sum_{i<r\le j<d}(i-j)b^{i+j-1}<0`$. Thus $`\Delta_{b,A}(N)\le\Delta_{2,A}(N)`$ for real $`b\ge2`$; for integer $`b`$ the rational-lattice argument gives irrationality. This ordinary argument is sharper than the factor-two bound in the Lean source’s [scalar comparison between bases](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos-lean/blob/52f29ad173b04e3bac941b3663f2b9aebe5de0bb/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/PaperCompleteR7/CoverKernel.lean#L232). Any prescribed positive divisor can be included in $`L`$, so the witnesses can also be required to be arbitrarily large. ◻

</div>

The same proof permits any positive weights $`\eta_j`$ with $`\sum_j\eta_j=1`$: replace $`2^{j\alpha_j}`$ in <a href="#eq:257-strengthened-cover" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-strengthened-cover">[eq:257-strengthened-cover]</a> by $`\eta_j^{-\alpha_j}`$ and take $`t_j=\varepsilon\eta_j`$.

<a id="combining-the-two-support-criteria"></a>

#### Combining the two support criteria

Separate small-displacement witnesses need not occur at the same index. For example, a sequence small only at even indices and one small only at odd indices need never have a small sum. The useful feature of <a href="#eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel">[eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel]</a> is its uniformity in the moving modulus: the positive-cover argument can use the exact observation window selected by the weighted proof.

**Theorem 3** (mixed weighted and cover supports). *Let $`E,V\subseteq\mathbb{N}_{>0}`$. Suppose $`E`$ has finite weighted mass <a href="#eq:257-weighted-mass" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-mass">[eq:257-weighted-mass]</a> at $`b=2`$ for a finite nonempty prime set $`\mathcal P`$.

Then $`X_A(b)`$ is irrational for every infinite $`A\subseteq E\cup V`$ and every integer $`b\ge2`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Fix $`\varepsilon>0`$ and an integer $`N_0\ge1`$, and put $`\rho=\varepsilon/3`$. Use the cover notation $`B_j,U_j,V_j`$ above, with $`\eta_j=2^{-j}`$ in the case <a href="#eq:257-strengthened-cover" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-strengthened-cover">[eq:257-strengthened-cover]</a>. Set $`t_j=\rho\eta_j`$ and choose $`J`$ so that
``` math
K_J=\sum_{j>J}\frac{C_jt_j^{-\alpha_j}}{B_j-1}<\frac1{16}.
```
Choose a finite $`F\subseteq E`$ whose complementary weighted mass is $`\kappa<\rho/16`$. Let $`L`$ be a positive common multiple of $`N_0`$, all members of $`F`$, and all members of the first $`J`$ covering sets. For large $`H`$, choose the modulus and averaging length from the base-two weighted proof:
``` math
Q=L\prod_{p\in\mathcal P}p^{\lfloor\log_pH\rfloor},\qquad
 G=\lfloor H/\max\mathcal P\rfloor,\qquad M=\lfloor2^{G/2}\rfloor.
```
The finite estimate <a href="#eq:257-weighted-final-diagonal" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-weighted-final-diagonal">[eq:257-weighted-final-diagonal]</a>, with complementary weighted mass $`\kappa`$, remains valid for this $`L`$: its proof requires only that every member of $`F`$ divide $`L`$. It also applies to finite or empty $`E`$, since positivity was used only after the averaging estimate. Thus
``` math
\mathscr D_{Q;M,M}(\Delta_{2,E}/\rho)<\frac18
```
for sufficiently large $`H`$. For the same finite distribution, <a href="#eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel">[eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel]</a> and nonnegative interchange give
``` math
\mathscr D_{Q;M,M}S_J\le(1+4Q/M)K_J<\frac18,
 \qquad S_J=\sum_{j>J}t_j^{-\alpha_j}V_j,
```
because $`Q/M\to0`$. Hence some sample $`N=Qm`$ satisfies $`\Delta_{2,E}(N)/\rho+S_J(N)<1`$. At this index the weighted displacement is below $`\rho`$ and $`U_j(N)<t_j`$ for every $`j>J`$. The earlier terms vanish because every exponent in their finite sets divides $`L`$, and hence divides $`N`$. Therefore
``` math
\Delta_{2,A}(N)\le\Delta_{2,E}(N)+\Delta_{2,V}(N)<2\rho<\varepsilon,
 \qquad N\ge Q\ge L\ge N_0.
```
Overlaps between the supports only improve the inequality. Infinitude of $`A`$ makes its displacement positive. The atom comparison used in the cover proof transfers arbitrarily small displacements to every integer base; the fixed rational lattice then excludes rationality. ◻

The positive-weight variant of Theorem <a href="#thm:257-variable-fractional-cover" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:257-variable-fractional-cover">2</a>, with its hereditary all-base conclusion, also has a [kernel-checked Lean proof](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f3f54798508b29ded6e854e0fa5784a560bd6cc7/lean/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/PaperCompleteR8/ArbitraryWeightMixedClaim.lean#L19). Theorem <a href="#thm:257-mixed-supports" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:257-mixed-supports">3</a> does not establish strict enlargement over both individual classes. A Lean source [constructs a weighted support with no strengthened cover](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos-lean/blob/52f29ad173b04e3bac941b3663f2b9aebe5de0bb/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/PaperCompleteR8/AnalyticSeparationReturn.lean#L16); a support with such a cover but no finite weighted mass is not constructed here. The theorem also leaves universal irrationality and the quantitative and prime-power thinning claims open.

With arbitrary positive cover weights, the class of subsets of such mixed hosts is closed under finite unions and finite changes. For weighted supports use the union of the two finite prime sets: the prime part grows and $`h/(2^h-1)`$ decreases. For two covers, interleave their finite sets with weights $`\eta_j/2`$ and $`\theta_j/2`$; the total cost grows by at most two, since $`2^{\alpha_j}\le2`$. Subsets inherit the same hosts, and finite sets have finite weighted mass. This argument uses the positive-weight variant; it does not silently reindex the dyadic weights in <a href="#eq:257-strengthened-cover" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-strengthened-cover">[eq:257-strengthened-cover]</a>. Countable unions require a tail budget. Every prime singleton is admitted, but for the full prime support $`\mathcal P`$ one has $`\Delta_{2,\mathcal P}(N)>1/3`$ for every $`N\ge1`$: indeed $`\sum_{r\ge1}2^{-r}\omega(N+r)\ge1`$, whereas $`X_{\mathcal P}(2)\le\sum_{a\ge2}(2^a-1)^{-1}<2/3`$. Here $`\omega(n)`$ is the number of distinct prime divisors of $`n`$.

<a id="the-elementary-independence-boundary."></a>

###### The elementary independence boundary.

For the divisor counts $`c_A`$ and a fixed $`a\in A`$, the identity $`c_A(an)-c_A(n)=1-\mathbf1_{a\mid n}`$ holds for every $`n\ge1`$ exactly when $`a`$ is coprime to every other member of $`A`$. Every summand $`\mathbf1_{t\mid an}-\mathbf1_{t\mid n}`$ is nonnegative; $`t=a`$ supplies the right side, and coprimality makes all other terms zero. If $`g=(a,t)>1`$ for some $`t\ne a`$, take $`n=t/g`$ to obtain an additional positive term. For distinct odd primes $`p,q`$, the covariance of $`\mathbf1_{2p\mid n}`$ and $`\mathbf1_{2q\mid n}`$ over a common period is $`1/(2pq)-1/(4pq)=1/(4pq)`$. Thus dilating a prime support already destroys the independence used in the prime-incidence argument. This brief ordinary calculation marks a boundary of that argument, not an irrationality criterion.

<a id="the-universal-problem-and-the-half-value-question"></a>

#### The universal problem and the half-value question

For an integer $`n \ge 1`$ set $`x_n := 1/(2^n-1)`$, and for $`A \subseteq \{1,2,3,\dots\}`$ write $`x_A := \sum_{n \in A} x_n`$; the sum always converges, since $`x_n = O(2^{-n})`$. Erdős’s Problem \#257 asks a single universally quantified question about this family.

<div id="defn:U" class="defn">

**Definition 4** (Universal \#257, written (U)). Is $`x_A = \sum_{n \in A} 1/(2^n-1)`$ irrational for *every* infinite $`A \subseteq \mathbb N_{>0}`$? **OPEN.**

</div>

<div id="defn:H" class="defn">

**Definition 5** (The half-value question, written (H)). Let the *Mersenne achievement set* be $`\mathcal{A} := \{\, y \in \mathbb{R}: \exists A \subseteq \mathbb{N},\ 0 \notin A,\ y = \sum_{n \in A} x_n \,\}`$ ([`mersenneAchievementSet`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean#L571)). Is $`1/2 \in \mathcal{A}`$? **OPEN.**

</div>

The two are joined by one elementary and completely one-sided implication. Every $`2^n-1`$ is odd, so every *finite* subset sum of $`\{x_n\}`$ has odd reduced denominator and cannot equal $`1/2`$ ([`positiveMersenneSupportValue_coe_finset_ne_half`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCutLocator.lean#L243)). Hence a witness to $`1/2 \in \mathcal{A}`$ is necessarily an infinite $`A`$ with $`x_A = 1/2`$ rational, which refutes (U) outright. Conversely, (U) implies $`1/2 \notin \mathcal{A}`$ as one instance among uncountably many, and a proof of $`1/2 \notin \mathcal{A}`$ leaves (U) entirely open. Thus (H) is one candidate counterexample to (U), not a restatement of it. Section <a href="#bar:asym" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="bar:asym">2.5</a> explains the corresponding difference between a finite certificate of nonmembership and an unbounded survival condition.

The reciprocal-summable and finite-prime weighted theorems, together with the checked support theorems below, leave (U) and (H) open. The later countermodels identify the particular arithmetic information lost by individual approaches; they do not prove that all such failures have one common cause.

<a id="known-support-theorems"></a>

#### Known support theorems

Full-support irrationality is Erdős’s theorem \[erdos1948\]. The pairwise-coprime case is Erdős’s theorem of 1968, where he also stated that the coprimality condition can be removed \[erdos1968, p. 222\]. Luca and Tachiya proved irrationality for every purely periodic integer weight that is not identically zero \[lucatachiya2017, Theorem A, p. 139\]; the purely periodic, eventually periodic, residue-class, odd-support and periodic-weight rows below follow from their theorem, and odd support is their Example 2 \[lucatachiya2017, p. 140\]. The lcm-gap supports, including factorials and powers of two, have summable reciprocals, so they fall under the reciprocal-summable theorem stated by Erdős. The Lean declarations in the table are formal proofs of these statements.

The following table includes two proof mechanisms: block certificates for the divisor counts $`c_A(n)`$, and rational-approximation estimates for a growing least-common-multiple gap. The latter need not be presented as instances of the former. The notation $`\operatorname{sc}_A(n)`$ in later source excerpts means the same function as $`c_A(n)`$. All bases in the table are integers $`b\ge2`$. For the lcm-gap row write $`L_k=\operatorname{lcm}(a_0,\ldots,a_{k-1})`$, with $`L_0=1`$.

The lcm-gap hypothesis does imply reciprocal summability. Eventually $`a_{k+2}>\operatorname{lcm}(a_k,a_{k+1})`$. If $`a_{k+1}\ge2a_k`$, monotonicity gives $`a_{k+2}>2a_k`$. Otherwise $`a_k\nmid a_{k+1}`$, so $`\operatorname{lcm}(a_k,a_{k+1})\ge2a_{k+1}>2a_k`$. Thus each of the even- and odd-indexed subsequences eventually grows geometrically, proving $`\sum_k1/a_k<\infty`$. This explains the inclusion claimed above, rather than using “lacunary” as a substitute for a growth hypothesis. For eventually periodic weights, the periodic tail must not be identically zero: an eventually zero weight sequence gives only a finite rational sum.

Full-support irrationality for every integer base $`b\ge2`$ is classical (Erdős, 1948). The contribution recorded here is its Lean formalisation and the explicitly delimited structured-support developments, not a new extension from base two to arbitrary integer bases. Each support family retains its stated hypotheses; none establishes irrationality for every infinite support. The $`b=2`$ case of the first row recovers the Erdős–Borwein constant $`E = \sum_{n \ge 1} 1/(2^n-1)`$ as a one-line corollary of that classical theorem. Separately, the independence and tail estimates used by a particular certificate construction must be checked for that support. Barrier <a href="#bar:box" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="bar:box">2.7</a> discusses those construction requirements; the averaging proof above does not assume pairwise coprimality or independence of divisor events.

A separate conditional result allows common factors confined to divisors of one fixed integer $`Q`$, while the remaining factors must be pairwise coprime and have summable reciprocals ([`irrational_erdosSupportSeries_of_orthogonalPetalBouquet`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/SupportSunflowerDichotomy.lean#L540)). It also assumes that for every $`K\ge1`$ there is an $`N\ge0`$ such that
``` math
2^K\mid\sum_{r=1}^K c_A(N+r)2^{K-r},\qquad
 \sum_{r\ge1}c_A(N+K+r)2^{-r}\le16.
```
Thus relaxing coprimality does not remove the simultaneous divisibility and tail-bound requirement. This additional hypothesis is not proved here, and the source file does not establish a dichotomy for arbitrary supports.

The record also gives a logarithmic bound on runs of zero divisor counts under rationality: for each $`\varepsilon>0`$, a suitable constant $`B`$ bounds the length by $`\varepsilon\log_2N+B`$ beyond the stated threshold ([`supportCoeffZeroWindow_length_le_eps_logb`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/SublogDivisorCoverage.lean#L435)). For these supports there is already a simpler unconditional bound. If $`a_0=\min A`$, every $`a_0`$ consecutive positive integers contain a multiple of $`a_0`$, where $`c_A`$ is positive. Hence every zero run has length at most $`a_0-1`$, whether or not $`X_A(2)`$ is rational. In particular the logarithmic bound alone does not distinguish rational-valued supports. The separate unbounded-tail result [`shifted_state_unbounded_of_infinite_support`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/RationalSupportCarrySkeleton.lean#L2327) also requires interpretation: an unbounded sequence can still satisfy $`u(N)=o(2^N)`$.

<div class="rem">

*Remark 6* (What is and is not covered in the universal direction). The Lean sources contain no theorem for $`A=`$ the primes, but this is a formalisation boundary, not a mathematical open case: Tao and Teräväinen prove the base-$`2`$ prime-support value irrational by first identifying it with $`\sum_{n\ge1}\omega(n)2^{-n}`$. Duverney and Tachiya likewise settle squarefree support at every power-of-two base, and the perfect $`i`$th powers at every integer base (Corollary 1.2 and Example 1.1, p. 4 of the author preprint). Neither result is formalised here. The statement of Problem #257 has been formalised before, as a conjecture with an unfilled proof, in the *Formal Conjectures* [collection](https://github.com/google-deepmind/formal-conjectures/blob/f776d2f2039351b00737ffcafb9d7d7666e1d9af/FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/257.lean); that file also proves the Lambert identity for the full-support value and states its irrationality, the 1948 theorem of Erdős, with proof `sorry`. It is statement-level prior art, and no theorem recorded here is derived from it. This record has no general theorem for an arbitrary positive-density nonperiodic or divisor-dense support, and the universal statement remains open.

<a id="periodic-weights-the-two-hypothesis-sets."></a>

###### Periodic weights: the two hypothesis sets.

The periodic sequence theorem belongs to Luca and Tachiya \[lucatachiya2014periodic\]; their later author-written account states it as Theorem A \[lucatachiya2017, p. 139\]. In the displayed Lean row above, nonnegativity and frequent nonvanishing are assumptions on $`c_w(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}w(d)`$, not on $`w(n)`$ itself. The formal row must therefore be read as a separately specified instance, not as an exact transcription of every clause of the published theorem.

<a id="a-separate-denominator-growth-criterion."></a>

###### A separate denominator-growth criterion.

Erdős’s growth theorem \[erdos1975\], as restated and recovered by Barreto, Kang, Kim, Kovač and Zhang \[bkkkz2026, Remark 4(4), p. 5\], gives irrationality of $`\sum_n1/a_n`$ for an increasing integer sequence with $`a_n\ge n^{1+\tau}`$ for some $`\tau>0`$ and $`\limsup_n a_n^{1/2^n}=\infty`$. For $`a_n=b^{c_n}-1`$, where $`c_n`$ are increasing positive exponents and $`b\ge2`$ is an integer, the growth hypothesis becomes
``` math
\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{c_n}{2^n}=\infty.
```
Indeed $`c_n\ge n`$, so the polynomial lower bound holds eventually, and $`\log_b(b^{c_n}-1)=c_n+O(1)`$. An eventual lower bound suffices: deleting finitely many terms subtracts a rational number and changes $`2^n`$ only by a fixed factor after reindexing.

This is not the reciprocal-summability condition of the reciprocal-support theorem in Section 1.1. The squares $`c_n=n^2`$ have convergent reciprocal sum but $`c_n/2^n\to0`$. In the other direction, set $`n_1=1`$ and $`n_{k+1}=n_k+4^{n_k}`$, and let block $`k`$ consist of all integers from $`4^{n_k}`$ to $`2\cdot4^{n_k}-1`$. The blocks are successive disjoint increasing blocks, and their union has increasing enumeration satisfying $`c_{n_k}=4^{n_k}`$. Thus $`c_{n_k}/2^{n_k}=2^{n_k}\to\infty`$, whereas each block has reciprocal sum at least $`1/2`$. Its reciprocal sum therefore diverges. These examples separate these two hypotheses, not every support criterion in this paper.

**Theorem 8** (Support-restricted refinement). *Use zero-based indices in this statement: coordinate $`j\in\mathbb{N}`$ carries weight $`w_{j+1}`$. For $`J\subseteq\mathbb{N}`$, consider the sums that use only coordinates in $`J`$. If $`\mathbb{N}\smallsetminus J`$ is finite, this achievement set has measure $`2^{-|\mathbb{N}\smallsetminus J|}`$; if infinitely many coordinates are omitted, its measure is zero. Injectivity survives every restriction; perfectness is proved when $`J`$ is infinite. No perfectness claim is made for finite $`J`$, whose coding range is finite.*

</div>

<a id="hausdorff-dimension-of-a-restricted-set."></a>

###### Hausdorff dimension of a restricted set.

For example, retaining the positive exponents $`2,4,6,\ldots`$ gives a set of measure zero but Hausdorff dimension $`1/2`$. More generally, let $`J\subseteq\{1,2,\ldots\}`$ and put
``` math
S_J=\left\{\sum_{n\in J}\varepsilon_nw_n:
                  \varepsilon_n\in\{0,1\}\right\},\qquad
 s_N=\#(J\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}),\qquad
 d=\liminf_{N\to\infty}s_N/N.
```
Then $`\dim_H S_J=d`$. Here is an ordinary proof, separate from the formal statements above. If $`J`$ is finite, both sides are zero, so suppose $`J`$ is infinite.

Write $`w_n=2^{-n}+\delta_n`$, where $`\delta_n=\sum_{r\ge2}2^{-rn}`$. A geometric sum gives
``` math
\sum_{k>n}\delta_k
 =\sum_{r\ge2}\frac{2^{-rn}}{2^r-1}\le\delta_n/3<\delta_n.
```
The unique Mersenne digit coding therefore defines a map from $`S_J`$ onto the binary digit-restricted set $`B_J=\{\sum_{n\in J}\varepsilon_n2^{-n}\}`$ by keeping the same digits. This map is $`1`$-Lipschitz. In fact, at the first differing digit $`n`$, the binary difference is nonnegative after orienting the larger digit first, and the Mersenne difference exceeds it by at least $`\delta_n-\sum_{k>n}\delta_k>0`$.

The $`2^{s_N}`$ Mersenne prefix intervals have length at most $`R_N\le2^{1-N}`$. For any $`t>d`$, a subsequence with $`s_N/N<(d+t)/2`$ makes their total $`t`$-power length tend to zero. Hence $`\dim_H S_J\le d`$. For the reverse inequality, give the allowed binary digits independent probabilities $`1/2`$. Each dyadic interval of length $`2^{-N}`$ has measure at most $`2^{-s_N}`$; endpoints have measure zero because $`J`$ is infinite. An interval $`I`$ with $`2^{-N-1}<|I|\le2^{-N}`$ meets at most three such dyadic intervals. For $`0<s<d`$ and all sufficiently large $`N`$, its measure is therefore at most $`3\cdot2^{-s_N}\le3\cdot2^s|I|^s`$. Summing this inequality over any sufficiently fine cover of $`B_J`$ gives a positive lower bound for the sum of its $`s`$-power lengths. Thus $`\dim_H B_J\ge s`$; letting $`s\uparrow d`$ proves $`\dim_H B_J\ge d`$. A Lipschitz map cannot increase Hausdorff dimension, since it sends a cover to one of no larger diameters. The map above now yields $`\dim_H S_J\ge d`$, as required. For $`d=0`$ the lower bound is automatic.

*Remark 9* (Achievement-set terminology and sources). We use the modern term *achievement set* for the subsum set that [Kakeya’s 1914 note](https://doi.org/10.11429/ptmps1907.7.14_250) describes as a set of partial sums. For an infinite summable sequence of positive terms, Kakeya proves perfectness, and nowhere density under an all-index strict-tail condition; [Kovač–Tao, Remark 4.1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17593v4) verifies that strict-tail condition for the fixed-base Mersenne weights. Nitecki proves that a subsum set whose terms all exceed their tails is a Cantor set of measure $`\lim_n2^nR_n`$, and credits this to Hornich \[nitecki2013, Theorem 4(1), p. 9\]; this is the classical source for the topology and measure used here. The volume dichotomy, injectivity, and greedy-membership statements above and below are proved in Lean. The sparse power-series criteria of [Kaneko–Suzuki–Tachiya](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20743) (Theorems 1–3, pp. 3–5 of arXiv v1) assume sparse coefficient supports; their relation to the divisor-incidence coefficients of these subseries is recorded after Theorem <a href="#thm:257-weighted" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:257-weighted">1</a>.

**Theorem 10** (Membership equals greedy survival; the fatal-gap dichotomy). *For a real target $`x\ge0`$, let $`r_n(x)`$ be the remainder after the greedy rule has processed weights $`w_1,\ldots,w_n`$, and let $`R_n=\sum_{j>n}w_j`$, with $`r_0(x)=x`$ and $`R_0=E`$. Then

Two boundary degeneracies are excluded at every rank, unconditionally: $`r_{k-1}(1/2)\ne w_k`$ by the odd-denominator argument above, and $`r_{k-1}(1/2)\ne R_k`$ because the tail differs from $`E`$ by a rational while $`E`$ is irrational. Both greedy decisions are therefore strict at every rank.

The following finite checks use exact integer arithmetic. Each has a [published program and saved result](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/tree/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257), including the scan to row $`200{,}000`$ and the grouped computation to depth $`13{,}548{,}057`$. Decimal margins summarise those integer data and give no asymptotic estimate. Reset margins are measured by $`\log_2|\mathrm{rem}(r+1)-2^{r+1}|-(r+5)/2`$. The separate real-greedy scan uses $`\log_2(4^k(r_{k-1}(1/2)-w_k))`$ at a take and $`\log_2(4^k(R_k-r_{k-1}(1/2)))`$ at a safe skip. These are different normalisations, not one common margin statistic. Truncation rungs $`J = 3,\dots,22`$ all *proved* to survive (not merely computed). Seam orbit certified to row $`200{,}000`$: branch counts $`\mathrm{R{:}M{:}U} = 100197{:}49899{:}49898`$, the target inequality failing at exactly one reset row, $`r = 7`$; maximal pure-R run $`19`$, attained at row $`158{,}096`$.

Independently, rows $`6 \le n \le 2500`$: $`1209`$ resets, zero classification anomalies, minimum in-scope margin $`+1.1119`$ bits at row $`14`$ growing to $`\approx 1246`$ bits by row $`2500`$ (mean $`627`$), never re-approaching the threshold.

Sharp tail margin, ranks $`2`$ to $`3000`$: no fatal skip, take fraction $`0.4992`$, tightest take-margin $`+0.0340`$ bits at rank $`7`$ (the near-tie $`1/126>1/127`$). In the stated units this is $`\log_2(4^7(1/126-1/127))=0.034035\ldots`$. It is the smallest take-margin reported in this finite scan. The finite greedy prefix through $`m=200{,}000`$, certified rank by rank with integer interval bounds ([saved run](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/receipts/greedy-prefix-200000.json)), satisfies $`0\le 1/2-\sum_{d\in G\cap[1,m]}w_d<2^{-199999}`$. The sum here is finite; this statement does not evaluate the infinite greedy sum.

A further exact finite computation, not used in the arguments here, regenerates the forced half-prefix support to depth $`13{,}548{,}057`$ ([program](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/half_prefix_coefficient_macro_verify.cpp), [saved run](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/receipts/coefficient-macro-13548057.json)). The reset rows $`13`$–$`30`$ are also verified in Lean by direct evaluation ([`seamUpperResetDyadicBandEscape_through_thirty`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderUpperResetBandCertificates.lean#L78)).

<div class="rem">

*Remark 11* (Literature, exactly). $`E`$ is irrational \[erdos1948\]. Zudilin proves the irrationality measure bound $`\mu(E)\le2.46497868\ldots`$ \[zudilin2004, Theorem 1, p. 154\], correcting an earlier computation (see the remark at the end of his Section 3, p. 159). Transcendence of $`E`$ is unknown \[duverneytachiya, p. 2\], and the Erdős–Graham conjecture that every such subset sum is irrational, i.e. (U), is itself open. For the binary digits of $`E`$, Erdős’s proof produces arbitrarily long runs of zeros. Crandall asked whether the block `11` occurs infinitely often in the binary expansion of $`E`$, and Campbell proves that it does \[campbell2026, Theorem 1, p. 12\].

</div>

The cited digit results establish the occurrence of particular patterns. An irrationality-measure estimate gives a different kind of information: a run of $`L`$ equal digits after position $`N`$ approximates $`E`$ by a dyadic rational with denominator at most $`2^N`$, giving $`L<(\mu(E)-1+\varepsilon)N`$ for all sufficiently large $`N`$. The reset argument considered here needs a bound for runs in its own inhomogeneous recurrence, not simply in the binary digits of $`E`$. No implication from the cited digit results to that bound is proved here. Such a bound is an input to this particular approach to (H), not a necessary ingredient of every possible proof of membership.

### Limitations of the recorded methods

<a id="what-the-obstructions-do-and-do-not-show"></a>

#### What the obstructions do and do not show

This section studies the scope of particular reformulations and certificate mechanisms. Several share the greedy representation, but no proof identifies a single necessary obstruction to all methods. The statements below are useful insofar as they specify which hypotheses fail, which implications are equivalences, and which parameters must be uniform. The first structural fact is uniqueness at a fixed target and depth.

<div id="obs:no-ensemble" class="obs">

*Observation 12* (Uniqueness within the fixed-target coding). Each Mersenne weight exceeds the sum of all subsequent weights. Consequently the digit coding is injective (Theorem <a href="#thm:geometry" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:geometry">7</a>): a represented target has only one support, recovered by the greedy rule. For the integer weights, both the scale and the cutoff matter. If $`2\le k\le M`$ and $`q_{M,d}=\lfloor2^M/(2^d-1)\rfloor`$ for $`2\le d\le k`$, then
``` math
q_{M,d}-\sum_{e=d+1}^{k}q_{M,e}\ge2^{M-k}.
```
Indeed, with $`w_d=(2^d-1)^{-1}`$ and $`R_k=\sum_{e>k}w_e`$,
``` math
w_d-\sum_{e=d+1}^{k}w_e=w_d-R_d+R_k>R_k>2^{-k}.
```
Rounding the head down loses less than one, while rounding the later terms down can only increase the difference. The resulting integer is greater than $`2^{M-k}-1`$, proving the bound. Comparing two words at their first differing rank gives the same separation for their sums. The rows with $`M=2s`$, $`k=s-1`$ and $`s\ge3`$ therefore have gap at least $`2^{s+1}`$; the full rows with $`k=M`$ have gap at least $`1`$. The first bound must not be applied after enlarging the cutoff: at $`M=6`$, adjoining rank $`3`$ introduces the subset sum $`q_{6,3}=9<16=2^{3+1}`$.

When a finite construction is proved to encode a fixed greedy target, its choices are constrained by that support. Injectivity alone does not identify an arbitrary finite approximation with a real greedy prefix. Nor does it exclude averaging over indices, moduli, nearby targets or auxiliary constructions.\

#### Uniqueness of the specified greedy words

<p class="evidence-marks"><a href="https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/c75e491ca57b70ba3a2b5a418c7acd49a53d8dfe/evidence/erdos257-mersenne-reasoning-surface/section-2.md#prop-canon">Lean</a></p>

**Proposition 13** (Uniqueness under the stated finite conditions). *Put $`G=\mathrm{greedyMersenneSupport}(1/2)`$, $`w_n=(2^n-1)^{-1}`$ and $`R_d=\sum_{n>d}w_n`$. The following are three separate uniqueness statements.*

1.  *If $`D\subseteq\{1,\ldots,d\}`$ and $`X_D(2)\le1/2\le X_D(2)+R_d`$, then $`D=G\cap\{1,\ldots,d\}`$.*

2.  *If $`c\ge4`$, $`D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,c-1\}`$ and $`0<1/2-X_D(2)<w_c`$, then $`D=G\cap\{1,\ldots,c-1\}`$.*

3.  *Let positive integer weights $`v_1,\ldots,v_k`$ satisfy $`v_i\ge g+\sum_{j>i}v_j`$ for a positive integer $`g`$. For a nonnegative integer target $`T`$, let $`y^*`$ be the word obtained by visiting these weights in order and taking each when it fits. An admissible Boolean word $`y`$ has $`0\le T-\sum_i y_iv_i<g`$ if and only if $`y=y^*`$ and $`0\le T-\sum_i y_i^*v_i<g`$.*

*Part (iii) gives uniqueness under the small-remainder condition, not existence. Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-i11a" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i11a">143</a> gives a one-weight counterexample to dropping that condition.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* For (i), truncate $`D`$ at each successive rank. The target remains in the corresponding prefix interval because all discarded terms are bounded by the complete tail. The two child intervals are disjoint: the lower one forces a greedy skip and the upper one forces a greedy take. Induction identifies every digit. Part (ii) implies (i) at depth $`c-1`$, since $`w_c<R_{c-1}`$. For (iii), consider the first disagreement with the integer greedy word. Taking a rejected weight would exceed $`T`$; rejecting an accepted weight leaves a deficit at least $`g`$, even after taking every later weight. The converse is immediate. ◻

</div>

**Excludes at fixed depth.** Under the three canonicalisation hypotheses just stated, a proof cannot gain freedom by choosing a different admissible word for the same target and depth. This says nothing about families satisfying different approximation conditions, or about averaging over depths or auxiliary data.

**What the finite tests show.** Three different calculations are recorded here. For unrestricted prefix residues, the proposed $`2^{t/2}`$ exclusion radius is reported to fail in $`74\%`$ of the tested ranks $`t\in[8,26]`$. Here the finite test uses the truncated, scaled fractional parts
``` math
b_d(t)=\left\lfloor 2^t\left\{\frac{2^t}{2^d-1}\right\}\right\rfloor,
 \qquad \{y\}=y-\lfloor y\rfloor.
```
At $`t=15`$, the values for $`d=2,3,5,6,10`$ are respectively $`21845,4681,1057,4161,1025`$. Their sum is $`32769=2^{15}+1`$, so the sum has circular distance one from $`0`$ modulo $`2^{15}`$. This is a statement about these integer truncations, not the exact fractional-part sum. A heuristic count of near-hits has size $`2^{t/6}`$; that estimate is not a theorem about the greedy support.

Long prescribed digit strings also occur for unrestricted finite words: the recorded examples at $`t=20`$ and $`t=22`$ have respectively eighteen leading ones and twenty leading zeros. A separate construction supplies about $`t/12`$ independently adjustable bits, with the reported finite check extending to $`t=601`$. These examples disprove the proposed static exclusions, not an assertion about the actual greedy word.

The integer-window search reported no counterexamples for $`t\le22`$ or at $`t=40,42,45`$ over the tested cut positions. That absence is a finite observation. Proposition <a href="#prop:canon" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:canon">13</a> explains why certain *specified* approximation conditions leave only the greedy word; it does not identify all three searches with one another or rule out averaging over other data.

<div class="rem">

*Remark 14* (A sufficient condition that is not necessary). The natural sufficient condition via fractional split-mass is *not* necessary on real crossing cores: the example $`D = \{2,3\}`$, $`c = 5`$ is an explicit counterexample ([`splitFractionMass_one_bound_not_necessary_fixture`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusSkippedCoreCriticalCapacity.lean#L183)). The example refutes necessity of that sufficient condition. It does not refute using the condition on a class of cores for which it can be proved.

#### Equivalent formulations of half-membership

The six conditions listed below are equivalent to half-membership. Their quantifier patterns can look less restrictive than a single compatible infinite construction, but the equivalences must be checked mathematically. They follow here from a carry identity and an unconditional tail estimate. No claim is made that every conceivable sufficient condition is equivalent to the goal.

**Proposition 16** (A cofinal carry bound). *If $`|\operatorname{ihc}(A,N)|\le C\sqrt{N+1}+C'`$ for arbitrarily large $`N`$, with fixed constants $`C,C'`$, then $`\delta=0`$. For the particular greedy support $`A=G`$ of $`1/2`$, a one-sided upper bound $`\operatorname{ihc}(G,N)\le C\sqrt{N+1}+C'`$ already suffices.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Lemma <a href="#lem:collapse-mech" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:collapse-mech">15</a> gives
``` math
2^{N+1}|\delta|
 \le |\operatorname{ihc}(A,N)|+\mathrm T(N+1).
```
The right side is $`O(\sqrt{N+1})`$ along the stated sequence, so division by $`2^{N+1}`$ yields $`\delta=0`$. For $`A=G`$, the greedy partial sums never exceed $`1/2`$, hence $`\delta\ge0`$ ([`erdosSupportSeries_greedyMersenneSupport_le`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCarryReachability.lean#L888)). Since $`\mathrm T(N+1)\ge0`$, the one-sided upper bound gives the same conclusion. Conversely, $`\delta=0`$ makes the carry equal to $`\mathrm T(N+1)`$, so the bound holds with $`C=2`$ and $`C'=4`$. This converse does not assert the bound for arbitrary prescribed constants. For a prescribed $`A`$, the conclusion is $`x_A=1/2`$; it is not merely membership witnessed by some other support. For $`A=G`$, this equality is equivalent to $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$ by [`mem_mersenneAchievementSet_iff_greedy_survival`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean#L1458). ◻

**Lemma 17** (The terminal bound at square depths). *Suppose $`x_A = 1/2`$ and $`1 \notin A`$. Then for every $`k \ge 1`$,
``` math
\operatorname{ihc}(A, k^2 - 1) \;=\; \mathrm{T}(k^2) \;\le\; 2k + 4 \;=\; \ensuremath{B}(k^2).
```*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* By Lemma <a href="#lem:collapse-mech" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:collapse-mech">15</a> with $`\delta = 0`$, $`\operatorname{ihc}(A,k^2-1) = \mathrm{T}(k^2)
\le 2\sqrt{k^2} + 4`$. At a perfect square the real and truncated square roots agree exactly, $`\sqrt{k^2} = k = \lfloor \sqrt{k^2} \rfloor`$, so the real envelope coincides with the discrete strip $`\ensuremath{B}(n) = 2\lfloor\sqrt n\rfloor + 4`$ ([`halfStripBound`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCarryReachability.lean#L32)) with no slack required. ◻

</div>

At the depths $`M=k^2`$, the real square root and the integer square root agree. Thus the reverse implication for the terminal bound uses the original constant $`4`$, not a relaxed constant $`6`$. Truncating an achieving support at $`M=k^2`$ leaves the carry at that depth unchanged, by [`integerHalfCarry_inter_Iic_eq_of_succ_le`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCarryReachability.lean#L49).

**Proposition 18** (Six equivalent membership conditions). *Each of the following is logically *equivalent* to $`1/2 \in \mathcal{A}`$, not strictly weaker:*

1.  *$`C_G(N)\le2\sqrt N+4`$ for every $`N\ge0`$;*

2.  *there are arbitrarily large positive exponents outside $`G`$;*

3.  *at arbitrarily large depths $`n`$, some $`D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,n\}`$ satisfies $`Q(D,n)=2^{n-1}-1`$; no agreement between the sets $`D`$ at different depths is required;*

4.  *at arbitrarily large $`M`$, $`\operatorname{ihc}(G,M)\le B(M+1)`$;*

5.  *at arbitrarily large positive depths $`M`$, some $`D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,M\}`$ satisfies $`|\operatorname{ihc}(D,M-1)|\le B(M)`$;*

6.  *the half-target greedy remainder never exceeds the full remaining tail, so no finite fatal gap exists; the seven equivalent forms in the later classification express this same condition.*

*For (d) and (e), the reverse directions use the square depths in Lemma <a href="#lem:sqrt-witness" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:sqrt-witness">17</a>. For (a), membership gives $`C_G(N)\le2\sqrt{N+1}+3\le2\sqrt N+4`$ when $`N\ge1`$, and $`C_G(0)=0`$. The forward implication still needs the greedy inequality $`x_G\le1/2`$.*

</div>

**Scope of the equivalences.** These conditions are equivalent to membership, not strictly weaker substitutes. Equivalence does not make a formulation useless as an invariant, but it does mean that proving any of them is the same problem as (H). The equivalent conditions remain unproved. In particular, mutually *incompatible* witnesses at different endpoints do not buy a weaker sufficient condition, and the $`\Pi^0_2`$ shape of these hypotheses is not evidence of extra room.

**Scope limit.** Item (a) does *not* extend to every $`A`$ with $`1 \notin A`$. Dropping the greedy-specific fact $`x_G \le 1/2`$ yields only the one-sided statement that the bound in (a), with $`A`$ in place of $`G`$, is equivalent to $`1/2 - x_A \le 0`$. Thus the conclusion for a general support is a one-sided inequality, not equality with $`1/2`$.

#### The size of the required error bounds

One sufficient half-membership argument requires the reset inequality
``` math
|\mathrm{rem}(r+1)-2^{r+1}|>2^{(r+5)/2}
 \qquad(r\ge10\text{ an upper or middle reset}).
```
For the normalised deviation $`\lambda_{r+1}=(\mathrm{rem}(r+1)-2^{r+1})/2^{r+1}`$, this is $`|\lambda_{r+1}|>2^{(3-r)/2}`$. A near-integer estimate for a weighted divisor sum is a proposed way to obtain information about this inequality, not an equivalent condition established here. Section <a href="#sec:invent-R1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:invent-R1">11.1</a> displays the exact recurrence and the additional, changing skip-set term. Each obstruction below has its own hypotheses; none excludes every method at the stated scale.

**Class (a): fixed precision or bounded state.** The following three statements concern abstract recurrence models. Their conclusions apply to the Mersenne problem only within the specified models; they do not use its full divisor-count constraints.

<div id="prop:local-void" class="prop">
<p class="evidence-marks"><a href="https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/c75e491ca57b70ba3a2b5a418c7acd49a53d8dfe/evidence/erdos257-mersenne-reasoning-surface/section-2.md#prop-local-void">Lean</a></p>

**Proposition 19** (Limits of the specified local summaries). *(i) After $`L`$ common steps the endpoint residue mod $`2^L`$ of an affine binary orbit is *independent* of the initial carry: $`u(L) - v(L) = 2^L(u_0 - v_0)`$. (ii) Fix $`m\ge2`$ and put $`h=\lfloor(m+1)/2\rfloor`$. Consider the coefficient sequences
``` math
c_r(m)=h-r,\qquad c_r(m+1)=2r,\qquad
 c_r(j)=0\ (j\ne m,m+1),\qquad 0\le r\le h.
```
Their binary sums are all $`h2^{-m}`$, and their scaled tails before position $`m`$ agree, but their scaled tails immediately after $`m`$ are $`r`$. Thus any exact label-and-decoder system recovering those latter tails must have at least $`h+1=\lfloor(m+1)/2\rfloor+1`$ labels. A state determined only by the common preceding history, with no new input, cannot distinguish them. (iii) For any starting carry and any finite list of prescribed valuations and odd unit residues modulo $`2^u`$, with $`u\ge1`$, there are integer input coefficients with those data whose successor carries lie in their prescribed centred intervals. The unrestricted higher bits of the input coefficients may be chosen separately at each step, as in Proposition <a href="#prop:2adic-nogo" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:2adic-nogo">256</a>, so these fixed-precision symbols alone do not exclude a completion in that specified family. This says nothing about extra constraints imposed by divisor counts from one common support.*

</div>

For an integer recurrence $`J(M+1)=2J(M)-\delta(M+1)`$, reduction modulo $`2`$ gives $`J(M+1)\equiv\delta(M+1)\pmod2`$. For the particular recurrence $`K(M+1)=2K(M)-(\tau(M+1)-1)`$, with $`K(2)=1`$, this gives, for $`M\ge2`$, that $`K(M)`$ is even exactly when $`M`$ is a square: divisors pair off except at a square. This is a genuine restriction at a specified index, but it is already encoded in the known forcing term. It supplies no additional run-length estimate by itself.

**Class (b): global averages and Diophantine data.**

**Proposition 20** (Weighted denominator budget). *Let $`n\ge2`$, let $`\mathrm{Skip}_n\subseteq\{2,\ldots,n-1\}`$, and let $`D_n`$ be the reduced denominator of the associated finite sum. Since $`D_n`$ divides the product of its Mersenne denominators,
``` math
\log_2D_n\le\sum_{d\in\mathrm{Skip}_n}\log_2(2^d-1)
 \le\sum_{d\in\mathrm{Skip}_n}d\le\frac{n(n-1)}2-1.
```
The middle inequality is strict when the skip set is nonempty; for an empty skip set both sums are zero. This is an upper bound, not a quadratic asymptotic for $`D_n`$. Combined with the cited fixed irrationality-measure exponent, it does not supply the required $`2^{-3n/2}`$-scale estimate. Even an asymptotic for the exponent sum would need additional information about the skip distribution.*

</div>

**Scope of these obstructions.** The common pre-index history in Proposition <a href="#prop:local-void" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:local-void">19</a>(ii) does not determine the post-index tail in its countermodel family. This does not exclude a state using additional arithmetic input from the actual support. The displayed denominator budget combined with the cited fixed irrationality-measure exponent does not yield the required run bound. These calculations do not exclude averaging over shifts, residues, or observation scales, nor a sharper analysis of the actual skip distribution.

**Prime steps and bounded windows.** In the universal recurrence, a prime step subtracts $`1`$, so it sends $`K(M)`$ to $`2K(M)-1`$; it is not exact doubling. Observation <a href="#obs:prime-doubling" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="obs:prime-doubling">253</a> gives an explicit frozen-row drift with values between $`2`$ and $`6`$ at the eleven indices $`607,\ldots,617`$, including the three prime indices $`607`$, $`613`$, and $`617`$. This finite example shows that prime steps can occur within a small-value window. It neither proves statistical independence nor rules out every argument using prime-counting information.

<div class="rem">

*Remark 21* (Status of the exhaustion claim). The preceding counterexamples concern the specified finite summaries and estimates. They do not classify all available tools, even within the broader categories of local information and global averages. No exhaustion claim is used in a subsequent deduction.

**Theorem 22** (One-sidedness). *Non-membership of $`1/2`$ in $`\mathcal A`$ has an effectively checkable finite-certificate formulation, hence a $`\Sigma^0_1`$ formulation. Membership has the complementary $`\Pi^0_1`$ formulation. Survival through a tested finite depth alone does not establish membership; a uniform theorem or inductive invariant could. The arithmetical-hierarchy form by itself proves neither undecidability nor the absence of finite proofs.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* The dichotomy $`1/2 \in \mathcal{A}`$ or $`\exists`$ a fatal gap is unconditional ([`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_or_exists_fatal_gap`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCutLocator.lean#L623)), and the two alternatives are exactly complementary ([`existsFatalHalfGap_iff_half_not_mem_mersenneAchievementSet`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCutLocator.lean#L643)), with [`ExistsFatalHalfGap`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCutLocator.lean#L526) a finite witness type. In the other direction, certified death implies non-membership ([`certifiedGreedyMersenneDeath_not_mem`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean#L1762), over [`CertifiedGreedyMersenneDeath`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean#L1756); $`3/4`$ is certified dead at level $`1`$, lookahead $`0`$, by [`three_fourths_certifiedGreedyMersenneDeath`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean#L1778)), whereas the absence of a certificate through depth $`D`$ alone gives no conclusion about later depths. To make the search effective, note that a greedy remainder at a finite rank is rational. The tail $`R_n`$ has rational upper bounds obtained by summing through a cutoff $`M`$ and bounding the remaining sum by $`2^{-M}+(2/3)4^{-M}`$. These upper bounds converge to $`R_n`$. Thus the strict inequality $`r_n(1/2)>R_n`$, when true, is witnessed by some finite cutoff and a comparison of rational numbers. Enumerating ranks and cutoffs gives the asserted finite-certificate search. Membership requires the survival inequality at every rank (Theorem <a href="#thm:greedy-survival" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:greedy-survival">10</a>). Checking a finite initial segment alone does not supply the later inequalities; a separate uniform argument or induction would be needed. ◻

</div>

**Finite search versus infinite survival.** A discovered fatal-gap certificate proves non-membership. Further surviving prefixes give larger verified ranges, but do not establish membership without an argument covering all ranks. This distinction is unchanged whether one increases the geometric truncation depth, the number of quotient rows, or the depth of a grouped computation. The different finite parameters should not be reported as a single verification depth.

#### Why measure and category do not decide a rational target

<div id="prop:soft" class="rem">

*Remark 23* (Achievement-set geometry does not decide rational-target membership). The achievement set has positive measure and is nowhere dense (Theorem <a href="#thm:geometry" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:geometry">7</a>). Neither fact alone decides membership of a specified rational. Injectivity fixes the support of an achievable value, but it does not exclude averaging over indices, shifts, residues, observation scales or auxiliary constructions. The recorded calculations obstruct the particular models and estimates analysed here; no impossibility theorem for all probabilistic, measure-theoretic or averaging methods is claimed.

</div>

The geometry itself is Lean-checked in Theorem <a href="#thm:geometry" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:geometry">7</a>: $`\mathcal{A}`$ has Lebesgue measure exactly $`1`$ inside an ambient span of $`E \approx 1.6067`$, a relative density of about $`62\%`$, and is simultaneously nowhere dense, perfect and totally disconnected. Those facts may hold together. They do not yield competing theorems about specified rationals. Showing that $`\mathcal{A}`$ is “small” cannot decide (U) by measure: it is $`62\%`$ of its ambient interval.

**A probabilistic heuristic.** An earlier heuristic calculation reports an expected count of about $`2\times10^{-4}`$ beyond $`n=31`$ in a Bernoulli$`(1/2)`$ digit model. This number is not a probability assigned to membership of the fixed point $`1/2`$. Such an interpretation would require a specified probability space, a definition of the failure events, and a link between those events and the deterministic greedy orbit. None is provided here. Section <a href="#sec:invent-R1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:invent-R1">11.1</a> separates a reproducible finite phase experiment from its unproved probabilistic application.

<a id="bar:box"></a>

#### Hypotheses of the CRT block-certificate argument

<div id="obs:box" class="obs">

*Observation 24* (Two inputs to the CRT certificate argument). The CRT block-certificate arguments considered here require both compatible divisibility prescriptions and a tail estimate strong enough for the height inequality $`q(C+N+L+2)<b^L`$. Pairwise coprimality is one way to obtain the first input; reciprocal summability is one way to obtain the second. This observation concerns those certificate arguments only. It does not describe all theorems in Section <a href="#sec:257-problem" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:257-problem">1</a>: the reciprocal-summable and weighted averaging proofs do not require pairwise coprimality.

</div>

**What remains to check.** One cannot apply a conditional CRT certificate theorem to arbitrary infinite $`A`$ without establishing its hypotheses. Shared factors impose compatibility conditions on the prescribed residues; they do not make every CRT construction impossible. The cited proof uses the tail budget in one step. Deleting that assumption does not complete the proof: one needs a replacement estimate for that step. This leaves open different constructions and different averaging arguments.

**Explains only a method boundary.** The primes are infinite and pairwise coprime, so they satisfy the first input. The identity [`compositeDilationDefect_eq_zero_of_prime_support`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CompositeDilationDefect.lean#L103) makes the dilation algebra exact there; yet this certificate theorem does not apply because $`\sum_p1/p`$ diverges, so the stated reciprocal-sum hypothesis fails. This explains the absence of a *Lean theorem from this certificate argument*; it does not make the base-$`2`$ value open, since Tao–Teräväinen settle it by a different analytic method. The sunflower generalisation inherits both axes and therefore does not recover that external theorem.

<a id="the-distinct-estimates-still-required"></a>

#### The distinct estimates still required

The half-target analysis involves a geometrically weighted divisor sum $`\sum_{i\le L}(\tau(M+i)-1)2^{-i}`$ and possible near-integer estimates. One universal-support certificate instead asks for an opening divisible block together with a controlled middle window. These inputs are related through incidence identities, but the displayed arguments do not prove them equivalent for all supports. They should therefore be retained as separate obligations. Digit-pattern occurrence results do not by themselves supply either required uniform estimate.

<a id="sec:257-survivors"></a>

### Unproved inputs for further arguments

The following proposals isolate inputs not supplied by the preceding results. Some are sufficient conditions, some are equivalent formulations, and one concerns reproducing an already known prime-support theorem. They are not an exhaustive list of possible approaches. The relevant question in each case is what must be proved, and whether the cited obstruction applies to that particular statement.

<a id="a-claimed-quantitative-support-condition"></a>

#### A claimed quantitative support condition

An analytic supplement that is not available here claims a second criterion admitting reciprocal-divergent supports. Put $`H_A(x)=\sum_{a\in A,\ a\le x}1/a`$, $`T_0=2`$, $`T_{j+1}=2^{T_j}`$, and $`\ell(x)=\min\{j:x\le T_j\}`$. The condition $`H_A(x)=o(\ell(x))`$ is claimed to imply all-base irrationality, with no positive density assumption on $`A`$. Neither a proof of this implication nor the claimed sharper rational-phase lower bound is available here.

<a id="two-further-analytic-tests"></a>

#### Two further analytic tests

Small displacements at a real base do not by themselves give the fixed rational lattice used in the integer-base proof. For $`\beta=(3+\sqrt5)/2`$, let $`u=\beta^{-1}`$ and $`H=\{2^km:k\ge2,\ m\text{ odd},\ m\le2^{2^k}\}`$. The finite prefix identity and an algebraic norm show that the condition
``` math
\Delta_{\beta,H}(N)
 \left(1+\sum_{\substack{a\in H\\a\le N}}
                 \sum_{j=1}^{\lfloor N/a\rfloor}u^{N-ja}\right)
 \longrightarrow0
```
along some sequence of positive integers $`N\to\infty`$ would exclude $`X_A(\beta)`$ from $`\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt5)`$ for every infinite $`A\subseteq H`$. The second factor controls the algebraic conjugate of the finite prefix; smallness of the displacement alone does not control this product. The product estimate remains unproved.

To justify the conditional implication, suppose instead that $`X_A(\beta)\in\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt5)`$, and choose an integer $`q\ge1`$ with $`qX_A(\beta)\in\mathbb{Z}[\beta]`$. The finite-prefix identity gives, for $`N\ge1`$,
``` math
Y_N:=q\Delta_{\beta,A}(N)
 =q(\beta^N-1)X_A(\beta)
  -q\sum_{\substack{a\in A\\a\le N}}
           \sum_{j=1}^{\lfloor N/a\rfloor}\beta^{N-ja}
 \in\mathbb{Z}[\beta].
```
The infinite support makes $`Y_N>0`$. Since $`\beta^2-3\beta+1=0`$, conjugation $`\sigma`$ sends $`\beta`$ to $`u=3-\beta\in(0,1)`$. For $`m,n\in\mathbb{Z}`$ the norm of $`m+n\beta`$ is $`m^2+3mn+n^2`$, so the nonzero $`Y_N`$ has nonzero integer norm. Moreover,
``` math
|\sigma(Y_N)|\le q\left(|\sigma(X_A(\beta))|
       +\sum_{\substack{a\in H\\a\le N}}
             \sum_{j=1}^{\lfloor N/a\rfloor}u^{N-ja}\right).
```
Using $`0<\Delta_{\beta,A}(N)\le\Delta_{\beta,H}(N)`$, we obtain
``` math
1\le |Y_N\sigma(Y_N)|
 \le q^2\max\{1,|\sigma(X_A(\beta))|\}\,
       \Delta_{\beta,H}(N)
       \left(1+\sum_{\substack{a\in H\\a\le N}}
                  \sum_{j=1}^{\lfloor N/a\rfloor}u^{N-ja}\right).
```
The asserted limit would contradict this inequality. The multiplier $`q`$ and the conjugate of the putative value are fixed, independently of $`N`$. This proves only the implication from the displayed product estimate, not that estimate.

A different extension requires squarefree remote-tail control and a weighted displacement to be small at the same indices. CRT establishes compatibility of the finite opening divisibility conditions, but not this simultaneous smallness. Neither argument is claimed to establish its required analytic hypothesis.

<a id="ssec:route-1"></a>

#### A lower bound at reset ranks

**What it needs.** Either of the first two sufficient conditions below. Their different scales do not establish an implication between them. The sign condition (iii) is a separate question; no implication from it to half-membership is proved here.

1.  *Reset-deviation bound.* For every upper or middle reset row $`r\ge10`$, require $`|\mathrm{rem}(r+1)-2^{r+1}|>2^{(r+5)/2}`$. Section <a href="#sec:o4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:o4">12.5</a> states the exact conditional implication to membership. A run-length estimate is a possible way to approach this bound, not an established exact reformulation of it.

2.  *Band avoidance at resets, already proved to imply membership.* For every reset $`d \ge 13`$ whose successor carries satisfy the hypotheses of Section <a href="#sec:o4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:o4">12.5</a> and every $`j \le d`$, the reset charge $`4\cdot\text{overshoot} + \text{abovePulse}`$ avoids the linear-width band $`(2^{d-j+1} - 2(d+j),\, 2^{d-j+1}]`$.

3.  *Sign law alone.* At every reset, M-resets have $`\mathrm{dev} > 0`$ and U-resets have $`\mathrm{dev} < 0`$. This specifies the sign but not a quantitative distance from zero. Neither an implication to half-membership nor a strict comparison with the first two conditions is established here.

*Sources.* [`SeamUpperResetDyadicBandEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4566) with conditional implication [`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_upperResetDyadicBandEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4790); quantifier collapse [`dyadicBandEscape_iff_exists_critical`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfUpperResetCriticalBand.lean#L108), which reduces the $`\forall j \in [0,d]`$ band check to one nearest-boundary index per row; finite verification [`seamUpperResetDyadicBandEscape_through_thirty`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderUpperResetBandCertificates.lean#L78); alternative implication [`LargestSkipLateStepSocket`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderLargestSkipInduction.lean#L34) with conditional implication [`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_largestSkipLateStepSocket`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderLargestSkipInduction.lean#L167) and base case [`largestSkipLateAt_fourteen`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderLargestSkipInduction.lean#L73).

**Logical strength.** The reset bound is a sufficient condition for half-membership in the cited argument. No converse is established here. The fact that it is quantitative, while membership is qualitative, does not prove that the condition is strictly stronger: that would require a separate implication or counterexample. The carry identity of Proposition <a href="#prop:collapse" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:collapse">16</a> does not itself furnish this lower bound on the reset deviation.

**What the finite checks establish.** The reported computation checks the reset inequality over its stated range, with margins of $`1.1119`$ bits at row $`14`$ and about $`1246`$ bits at row $`2500`$; the reported mean is $`627`$ bits. These are finite observations, not a proof of an asymptotic lower bound or of the inequality at every later reset.

Uniqueness in Section <a href="#bar:canon" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="bar:canon">2.2</a> does not prevent this argument: the proposed bound concerns the actual greedy sequence. It does not require alternative supports for the same target.

**Run lengths.** The record reports a maximum right-branch run of length $`19`$ at row $`158{,}096`$, far below the proposed threshold $`(r-3)/2=79{,}046.5`$ there. Observing larger runs at larger ranks does not refute the existence of some uniform finite bound. Neither a uniform bound nor the weaker asymptotic assertion $`L_r=o(r)`$ is proved by these data. The stated implication needs the required inequality beyond the verified initial ranks.

The missing step is the quantitative lower bound itself. The finite observations do not supply the growing-precision estimate discussed in Section <a href="#bar:scale" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="bar:scale">2.4</a>; it remains unproved.

<a id="ssec:route-2"></a>

#### Increasing the depths of exact finite sums

**What it needs.** Rule out the recycle branch returning to a bounded endpoint forever. Any one of:

1.  *critical quotient supply*: for every below-half core $`D`$ bounded by $`[2,c)`$ with genuine crossing deficit, $`2^{(2c-2)-1} \le \ensuremath{Q}\,(\mathrm{insert}\
      c\ D)\,(2c-2)`$;

2.  a direct proof that the crossing rank $`c`$ produced by the recycle branch cannot repeat the value $`4`$, or any bounded value, infinitely often;

3.  a growth law for $`c`$ as a function of the incoming endpoint $`n`$.

By Proposition <a href="#prop:canon" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:canon">13</a>(ii), form (a) need only be checked along the *one* canonical orbit, the half-target greedy prefix, not searched over $`D`$; and by the recorded sharp-capacity biconditional it is exactly the $`c-2`$ bit capacity test $`\ensuremath{S}\,D\,1\,(2c-2) < 2^{c-2}`$. The example $`D=\{2,3\}`$, $`c=5`$ shows that the fractional-mass sufficient condition is not necessary. It does not rule out proving that condition for a suitably restricted family.

**The finite-row test and its unique candidate.** The real-prefix argument in Proposition <a href="#prop:canon" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:canon">13</a>(ii) does not by itself identify an exact-row witness. The integer weights have a separate, decisive property: for fixed $`n\ge2`$,
``` math
q_{n,d}=\left\lfloor\frac{2^n}{2^d-1}\right\rfloor
 \quad(2\le d\le n)
```
form a decreasing sequence in which each weight exceeds the sum of all later weights by at least $`1`$. Apply the integer greedy rule with capacity $`2^{n-1}-1`$: visit $`d=2,\ldots,n`$ and subtract $`q_{n,d}`$ when it fits. By Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-i11a" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i11a">143</a> and Propositions <a href="#record:257bm-i11b" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i11b">144</a>–<a href="#record:257bm-i11c" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i11c">145</a>, any exact-row witness has zero remainder and must be this greedy word. Thus there is at most one witness at a fixed depth, and its existence is tested by checking whether the final greedy remainder is zero. An exhaustive search over $`2^{n-1}`$ subsets is unnecessary.

This integer greedy word should not be silently identified with the real greedy prefix $`G\cap[2,n]`$: the two rules use different weights. The separation theorem proves uniqueness within the integer problem, not that identification.

**Finite decidability and the cofinal requirement.** The test decides the exact-row predicate at any specified depth. The claim that successful depths are arbitrarily large is still equivalent to half-membership, by Proposition <a href="#prop:collapsed-list" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:collapsed-list">18</a>(c). Neither uniqueness nor finite decidability supplies that cofinal assertion. The double-or-recycle argument must prove genuine progress in the depths, not rely on a purported freedom to choose many witnesses at one depth.

<a id="ssec:route-3"></a>

#### The known prime-support theorem

The base-$`2`$ prime-support value is not an open target:
``` math
\sum_{p\ {\rm prime}}\frac1{2^p-1}
  =\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\omega(n)}{2^n}
```
by expanding each reciprocal Mersenne term geometrically and collecting divisors. Tao and Teräväinen prove the right-hand series irrational in Theorem 1.3 of [*Quantitative correlations and some problems on prime factors of consecutive integers*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01739). Their proof is analytic and is cited here; it is not formalised in Lean.

The local pairwise-coprime certificate theorem still does not cover the primes because it assumes summability of $`\sum_p1/p`$. That is a boundary of this certificate theorem, not a boundary of the mathematics. The previously proposed windowed-tail repair is therefore withdrawn as a research contribution. It may remain useful as a test of whether the existing Lean certificate theorem can reproduce the known theorem, but reproducing a cited result is not new progress on \#257. After Theorem 1.3 the authors state the prime-support extension to every integer base $`b\ge2`$ and, separately, the full prime-power result at base $`2`$, leaving those modifications to the reader. These statements should not be combined into an attributed all-base theorem for arbitrary prime-power subsets.

<a id="ssec:route-4"></a>

#### Equivalent membership conditions

Proposition <a href="#prop:collapsed-list" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:collapsed-list">18</a> lists the equivalent conditions: a pointwise upper bound on $`C_G`$, infinitely many skipped ranks, exact quotient sums at unbounded depths, and the two cofinal carry bounds. For the carry conditions, the residual identity and its tail estimates are the relevant inputs: [`integerHalfCarry_eq_scaled_residual_add_tail`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCarryReachability.lean#L871), [`binaryCoeffTail_nonneg`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GenericTailOrbitRigidity.lean#L78), [`binaryCoeffTail_supportCoeff_le_two_sqrt_add_four`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusCarry.lean#L290), and, for the terminal-strip conditions, evaluation of the square root at a perfect square. The one-sided scope limitation in Proposition <a href="#prop:collapsed-list" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:collapsed-list">18</a> still applies to general supports.

**Purpose of the equivalences.** These results identify the exact logical content of the proposed hypotheses. They do not settle half-membership, nor do they make an equivalent formulation useless: a different expression of the same condition may expose an invariant or a more convenient induction. The formalisation task is separate from the unproved arithmetic assertion on either side.

<a id="ssec:route-5"></a>

#### Why zero windows do not split the support class

One proposed split asks whether every infinite support satisfies
``` math
\begin{gathered}
 \text{$c_A$ has arbitrarily late super-logarithmic zero windows}\\
 \text{or a weighted block certificate exists at every precision.}
 \end{gathered}
```
For the present divisor counts, the first alternative never occurs. Writing $`a_0=\min A`$, every run of zeros has length at most $`a_0-1`$, since each $`a_0`$ consecutive integers contain a multiple of $`a_0`$. The logarithmic estimate [`supportCoeffZeroWindow_length_le_eps_logb`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/SublogDivisorCoverage.lean#L435) therefore does not split the support class into two useful cases. The lcm-gap theorem [`irrational_erdosSum_of_lcm_gap`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean#L5883) remains an independent irrationality result, not an instance of this zero-window alternative. The proposed assertion consequently requires block certificates for every infinite support: for each required precision, one must construct an opening block with $`2^K\mid\sum_{r=1}^Kc_A(N+r)2^{K-r}`$, a bounded middle contribution $`C`$, and $`q(C+N+L+2)<2^L`$.

This reformulation does not remove the CRT compatibility and tail-estimate requirements of Section <a href="#bar:box" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="bar:box">2.7</a>. It asks for a new construction that meets them for general supports. Nor does it identify that construction with the reset estimate used for the half-target: the two arguments use related divisor-count identities, but no equivalence of their missing hypotheses is proved here.

<a id="comparison-of-the-remaining-inputs"></a>

#### Comparison of the remaining inputs

Route 4 packages recorded equivalences; it does not establish their unproved existence hypotheses. Route 3 must be compared with the external prime-support theorem of Tao and Teräväinen \[taoteravainen2025, Theorem 1.3\]; reproducing it in this framework requires its own analytic input. Route 2 offers a different finite search space under the conditions stated there. Routes 1 and 5 share some incidence identities, but this is not a proof that every missing hypothesis is equivalent. The appropriate comparison is the input each route needs, its quantifiers, and what a successful estimate would imply.

The catalogue in Part III may be entered by topic: the certificate method and universal-direction record; the greedy and achievement-set geometry; the integer-quotient model, quotient identity, and dynamics; the half-carry and Boolean–Möbius formulations; and the support rigidity results. The later implication tables record what chains with what, while the near-miss index gives the exact mismatch at each open obligation.

<a id="finite-ranges-and-unbounded-statements."></a>

###### Finite ranges and unbounded statements.

The directly verified instances stay in finite ranges: rungs $`J \le 22`$, seam rows $`\le 200{,}000`$, ranks $`\le 3000`$, and depth $`\le 13{,}548{,}057`$ in the further computation; the open obligations require arbitrarily large parameters. Theorem <a href="#thm:one-sided" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:one-sided">22</a> shows that extending a bounded range does not establish such a statement. Likewise, an obstruction proved in one representation, for example the greedy recurrence, the integer quotients or the Diophantine formulation, does not transfer to another representation without a proved map.

#### The object

In this part, write $`x_n=w_n=(2^n-1)^{-1}`$ for every positive integer $`n`$, and $`x_A=X_A(2)=\sum_{n\in A}x_n`$ for $`A\subseteq\mathbb N_{>0}`$. These series converge by comparison with $`\sum_n2^{-n}`$. Exponent $`1`$ contributes the rational number $`x_1=1`$, so deleting or adjoining it does not affect irrationality. It cannot occur in a representation of $`1/2`$; those calculations therefore start at exponent $`2`$.

**Definition 25** (Universal Problem \#257). **Is $`x_A = \sum_{n \in A} 1/(2^n-1)`$ irrational for *every* infinite $`A \subseteq \mathbb{N}_{>0}`$?** The quantifier ranges over all infinite sets of positive exponents. It is **OPEN**.

The support theorems prove irrationality for specified infinite families. The following question instead asks whether one particular rational number is represented. A positive answer would disprove the universal assertion; a negative answer would settle only that target. The later analysis also treats $`1/21`$.

**Definition 26** (The distinguished half-value question). Define the *Mersenne achievement set* $`\mathcal{A} := \{\,y \in \mathbb{R} : \exists A \subseteq \mathbb{N},\ 0 \notin A,\ y =
\sum_{n \in A} x_n\,\}`$, the set of reals realizable as a subset sum of the positive-index Mersenne weights $`\{x_n\}_{n \ge 1}`$. **Is $`1/2 \in \mathcal{A}`$?** This is **OPEN**.

</div>

<div id="obs:half-controls-universal" class="obs">

*Observation 27* (Why the half-value question controls universal \#257). Any finite subset sum of $`\{x_n\}`$ has odd reduced denominator, since every $`2^n - 1`$ is odd; hence no finite $`A`$ can sum to $`1/2`$ ([`positiveMersenneSupportValue_coe_finset_ne_half`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCutLocator.lean#L243)). Consequently, *if* $`1/2 \in \mathcal{A}`$, the witnessing support $`A`$ is necessarily infinite, and $`x_A = 1/2`$ is rational. Such an $`A`$ is then a single infinite set for which the universal-#257 sum is rational – an outright refutation of universal \#257. Conversely, universal \#257 being true forces $`1/2 \notin \mathcal{A}`$ as one instance among uncountably many. The half-value question is therefore one concrete test of the negation, not a restatement of the universal problem. Excluding $`1/2`$ would not exclude every other rational value, even though the support theorems already settle many infinite families. Representing $`1/2`$ would give an infinite-support counterexample to the universal assertion.

``` math
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{b^{k+1}-1} \quad \text{is irrational.}
```
**Hypotheses:** $`b \in \mathbb{N}`$, $`b \ge 2`$. **Conclusion:** unconditional irrationality of the full-support Erdős–Borwein-type series at every base, not merely base $`2`$. The base-$`2`$ instance recovering the classical Erdős–Borwein constant’s irrationality is a one-line corollary.*

This formalizes the positive-integer-base scope of [Erdős’s classical 1948 full-support theorem](https://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1948-04.pdf), which already covered integer bases of absolute value greater than one. The base-two Erdős–Borwein constant is a particular case; the Lean theorem is recorded with no open hypotheses.

Beyond full support ($`A = \{1,2,3,\dots\}`$, i.e. $`m=1`$ below), the following named infinite families are proved irrational for every integer base $`b\ge2`$. The purely periodic, eventually periodic, residue-class and odd supports follow from the periodic theorem of Luca and Tachiya \[lucatachiya2017, Theorem A, p. 139\], and the declarations below are formal proofs of these cases:

</div>

A support representing $`1/2`$ cannot be eventually periodic, by these irrationality theorems. This is a restriction on a hypothetical representation, not a proof that the actual greedy support is nonperiodic: if the greedy construction fails, it eventually selects every exponent. The periodic-support results therefore decide neither alternative for $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$.

**Theorem 33** (Achievement-set topology and measure). *$`\mathcal{A}`$ (Definition <a href="#defn:half-question" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="defn:half-question">26</a>) is compact, closed, perfect, totally disconnected, and nowhere dense; its Lebesgue measure is exactly $`1`$: $`\operatorname{volume}(\mathcal{A}) = 1`$. **Hypotheses:** none. **Conclusion:** $`\mathcal A`$ is a Cantor set of positive measure, often called a fat Cantor set. Its measure is $`1`$, not the length of its ambient interval $`[0,E]`$, where $`E\approx1.6067`$. Strict separation and summability give the compactness, unique coding, and Cantor topology, and Hornich’s strict-tail theorem, as proved by Nitecki \[nitecki2013, Theorem 4(1), p. 9\], gives the measure as $`\lim_N2^NR_N`$ with $`R_N=\sum_{n>N}x_n`$: each level-$`N`$ cylinder has length $`R_N`$, and the $`2^N`$ disjoint cylinders have total length $`2^NR_N`$. The Mersenne-specific input is $`2^NR_N\to1`$. Other weight sequences require their own tail asymptotic.\

**Theorem 34** (Membership equals greedy survival at every level). *For a real $`x`$, let $`r_n(x)`$ be its greedy remainder after rank $`n`$, and let $`R_n=\sum_{j>n}w_j`$, as in the initial notation. Then
``` math

#### The greedy rule for one half

Fix the target $`1/2`$ and the weights $`x_n = 1/(2^n-1)`$. Here $`x_1=1`$, so exponent one cannot occur in a representation of $`1/2`$ by positive summands; the half-target discussion starts at exponent two. (The reciprocal formula is undefined only at exponent zero.) The greedy rule is deterministic. Strict tail domination makes it recover the support of any represented target (Theorem <a href="#thm:greedy-survival-record" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:greedy-survival-record">34</a>):

<div id="defn:greedy-orbit" class="defn">

**Definition 35** (The half-value greedy orbit). Let $`\rho_k=r_{k-1}(1/2)`$ be the residual entering rank $`k`$, so $`\rho_2=1/2`$. In this subsection $`x_k=w_k`$ and $`T_{k+1}=R_k=\sum_{j>k}w_j`$. At rank $`k\ge2`$:

- **Take** iff $`\rho_k \ge x_k`$; if taken, $`\rho_{k+1} := \rho_k - x_k`$.

- **Skip** otherwise; $`\rho_{k+1} := \rho_k`$.

A skip at rank $`k`$ is:

- **safe** iff $`\rho_k \le T_{k+1} := \sum_{j>k} x_j`$ (the total remaining mass does not yet rule out a representation; this inequality alone does not guarantee one);

- **fatal** iff $`\rho_k \in (T_{k+1}, x_k)`$ (the residual is too large for the remaining tail to ever reach, yet too small to have been taken at $`k`$ – an impossible gap).

</div>

For example, ranks $`2`$ and $`3`$ are selected, leaving $`1/2-1/3-1/7=1/42`$. Ranks $`4`$ and $`5`$ are skipped, while rank $`6`$ is selected and leaves $`1/126`$. These decisions illustrate the rule; they do not establish its infinite survival.

By Theorem <a href="#thm:greedy-survival-record" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:greedy-survival-record">34</a>, $`1/2 \in \mathcal{A}`$ iff no rank of this orbit is ever fatal. Two boundary degeneracies are excluded unconditionally and independently of any open hypothesis:

<div id="rem:no-ties" class="rem">

*Remark 36* (No-ties: both greedy-orbit boundaries are strict). (a) $`\rho_k \ne x_k`$ at any rank: a finite Mersenne sum has odd reduced denominator (each $`2^n-1`$ is odd), so the residual $`1/2`$ minus a finite prefix cannot equal the odd-denominator number $`x_k`$, sharpening the general denominator-parity fact used in Observation <a href="#obs:half-controls-universal" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="obs:half-controls-universal">27</a>. (b) $`\rho_k \ne T_{k+1}`$ at any rank: the tail $`T_{k+1} = E - 1 - \sum_{2 \le j \le k} x_j`$, where $`E := \sum_{n\ge1} x_n`$ is the Erdős–Borwein constant, is irrational by Erdős’s own 1948 theorem (the base-$`2`$ case of Theorem <a href="#thm:full-support" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:full-support">28</a>), while $`\rho_k`$ is always rational; equality is impossible. **Conclusion:** both greedy-orbit boundaries are provably strict at every rank, so the orbit’s decisions stabilize after finitely many strict inequalities at any fixed truncation depth.

#### Integer quotients and their remainder identity

The quotient rows are finite integer approximations to the real greedy rule, not identical finite stages of that rule. Their normalised weights tend to the Mersenne weights and their targets tend to $`1/2`$. Proposition <a href="#prop:one-orbit" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:one-orbit">191</a> proves agreement at each fixed prefix once the row index is sufficiently large; it does not assert simultaneous agreement at all ranks. Fix a row $`n\ge6`$. The integer quotient weights at row $`n`$ are
``` math
w(n,d) := \left\lfloor \frac{4^n}{2^d-1} \right\rfloor, \qquad d = 2,\dots,n-1,
```
and the integer target is $`T_n := 2^{2n-1} - 2^n`$. The integer greedy process takes ranks $`d = 2,\dots,n-1`$ in ascending order against $`T_n`$ exactly as in Definition <a href="#defn:greedy-orbit" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="defn:greedy-orbit">35</a>, producing a take set $`D_n \subseteq \{2,\dots,n-1\}`$ and skip set $`\mathrm{Skip}_n := \{2,\dots,n-1\} \mathbin{\backslash} D_n`$. Define the *integer remainder* $`\mathrm{rem}(n) := T_n - \sum_{d \in D_n} w(n,d)`$ and the *scaled remainder deviation* $`\Delta_n := \mathrm{rem}(n) - 2^n`$.

<div class="defn">

**Definition 37** (The full-support quotient recurrence). For $`M \ge 2`$, define
``` math
K(M) := 2^{M-1} - \sum_{d=2}^{M} \left\lfloor \frac{2^M}{2^d-1} \right\rfloor.
```
This depends only on $`M`$, not on the selected support in a quotient row. The floor-quotient recurrence gives
``` math
K(2)=1,\qquad K(M+1)=2K(M)-(\tau(M+1)-1).
```
Here $`\tau(n)`$ counts the positive divisors of $`n`$. To see the correction term, double the quotients for $`2\le d\le M`$ and add one for each such $`d`$ dividing $`M+1`$. The new endpoint $`d=M+1`$ contributes one more quotient. Together these are exactly the $`\tau(M+1)-1`$ divisors at least two. This is an identity for every $`M\ge2`$, not merely a checked finite recurrence.

**Theorem 38** (Decomposition of the integer remainder). *For every quotient row $`n \ge 6`$,
``` math
\begin{equation*}
\Delta_n \;=\; K(2n) \;+\; \sum_{d \in \mathrm{Skip}_n} \left\lfloor \frac{4^n}{2^d-1} \right\rfloor.
\tag{I}
\end{equation*}
```
Here the take and skip sets, capacity and remainder are those defined at the start of this subsection. The identity separates the contribution of the full exponent range from that of the omitted ranks. It makes no claim that there are few omitted ranks; controlling their sum is a separate part of any application.\
**Proof.** For $`d=n`$ the quotient is $`2^n+1`$, and for $`n<d\le2n`$ it is $`2^{2n-d}`$. Hence
``` math
\sum_{d=n}^{2n}\left\lfloor\frac{4^n}{2^d-1}\right\rfloor
 =2^n+1+\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}2^j=2^{n+1}.
```
Substitute this in the definition of $`K(2n)`$, split $`\{2,\ldots,n-1\}=D_n\sqcup\mathrm{Skip}_n`$, and use $`\Delta_n=2^{2n-1}-2^{n+1}-\sum_{d\in D_n}w(n,d)`$. This gives (I). **Certification:** rows $`6\le n\le200`$ rechecked with zero mismatches by an exact [program](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/check_master_identity.py) (§<a href="#ssec:anchors" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ssec:anchors">5.7</a>).\
*Use:* (I) permits substitution of information about $`K(2n)`$. A resulting estimate for $`\Delta_n`$ must also retain or bound the skip-set sum; information about $`K`$ alone need not control their cancellation.*

**Theorem 39** (Real (non-integer) form of the quotient identity). *Let $`x_d := 1/(2^d-1)`$ and define the constant
``` math
C \;:=\; \sum_{d \ge 2} x_d \;-\; \tfrac12 \;=\; E - \tfrac32 \;=\; 0.1066951524152917\ldots,
```
where $`E`$ is the Erdős–Borwein constant. Then, for every quotient row $`n \ge 6`$,
``` math
\begin{equation*}
\Delta_n \;=\; 4^n \Big( \sum_{d \in \mathrm{Skip}_n} x_d \;-\; C \Big) \;+\; \eta_n, \qquad
|\eta_n| < 2n+2.
\tag{II}
\end{equation*}
```
**Proof.** Splitting the full series at $`n`$ gives
``` math
\eta_n=4^nR_{n-1}-2^{n+1}
       +\sum_{d\in D_n}\left\{\frac{4^n}{2^d-1}\right\}.
```
The tail bounds $`2^{-(n-1)}<R_{n-1}\le
2^{-(n-1)}+\tfrac23 4^{-(n-1)}`$ and $`|D_n|\le n-2`$ show $`0<\eta_n<n+2/3<2n+2`$.*

***Use of the error bound.** For $`H>2n+2`$, the condition $`|\sum_{d\in\mathrm{Skip}_n}x_d-C|>(H+2n+2)/4^n`$ is sufficient for $`|\Delta_n|>H`$. Conversely, $`|\Delta_n|>H`$ implies $`|\sum_{d\in\mathrm{Skip}_n}x_d-C|>(H-2n-2)/4^n`$. Thus a square-root-exponential deviation corresponds to a separation of order $`2^{-3n/2}`$, with the displayed additive error retained. This is not an exact equivalence after simply discarding that error.\
**Note:** $`C = E - 3/2`$ is Mersenne-specific, but the shape “scaled deviation $`=`$ $`4^n \cdot`$(finite skip-sum $`-`$ target constant) $`+ O(n)`$” is a template, not yet matched to any analogous constant on the \#249 side.*

**Theorem 40** (Exact recurrences for the three branches). *Fix $`n\ge5`$. Among the quotient sums over subsets of $`\{2,\ldots,n-1\}`$, let $`D_n`$ give the largest sum at most $`T_n`$ and let $`B_n`$ give the smallest sum strictly greater than $`T_n`$. Thus $`D_n`$ is the greedy support already defined. Put
``` math
r=\mathrm{rem}(n),\qquad o=Q(B_n,2n)-T_n,
```
and define the two correction terms by
``` math
p^- =\sum_{d\in D_n}\bigl(2\mathbf1_{d\mid2n+1}

                              +\mathbf1_{d\mid2n+2}\bigr).
```
Both lie in $`[0,2(n-2)]`$, since $`d\ge2`$ cannot divide both consecutive integers. The next remainder is
``` math
\mathrm{rem}(n+1)=
 \begin{cases}
 2^{n+1}-4o-p^+,&\text{if }4o+p^+\le2^{n+1}\quad(\mathrm U),\\
 4r+2^{n+1}-p^-,&\text{if not }\mathrm U\text{ and }

q(2n+2,d)=4q(2n,d)+2\mathbf1_{d\mid2n+1}
                         +\mathbf1_{d\mid2n+2}.
```
The new capacity is $`T_{n+1}=4T_n+2^{n+1}`$, and the new terminal weight, at exponent $`n`$, is $`q(2n+2,n)=2^{n+2}+4`$. Write $`g=2^{n+1}`$. The old quotient sums are separated by at least $`g`$, so the corrected sums remain separated by at least $`4g-2(n-2)>2g+4`$. This exceeds the new terminal weight. The upper word exists: already the terms at $`d=2,3,4`$ have sum greater than $`T_n`$ for $`n\ge5`$, since $`1/3+1/7+1/15=19/35>1/2`$ and their total floor error is less than $`3`$. Consequently, adding the terminal weight to a lower old word cannot pass the next corrected old word. Moreover, the increment $`T_{n+1}-4T_n=g`$ is smaller than this separation, so no old word beyond the adjacent upper one can fit. It is therefore enough to compare the two adjacent old words and the terminal weight. The upper word fits precisely under the condition $`\mathrm U`$; its remainder is then too small to take the terminal weight. Otherwise the lower word is used, and comparison with the terminal weight gives $`\mathrm M`$ or $`\mathrm R`$. Substitution yields the displayed formulas. Lean sources give the corresponding [abstract adjacent-cut identity](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos-lean/blob/52f29ad173b04e3bac941b3663f2b9aebe5de0bb/Erdos257PeriodNoncollapse/HalfCylinderIntegerGreedy.lean#L1463) and [its identification with the concrete greedy row](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos-lean/blob/52f29ad173b04e3bac941b3663f2b9aebe5de0bb/Erdos257PeriodNoncollapse/HalfCylinderConcreteSeamAdapter.lean#L699); they were inspected for this proof, and no new compilation of them is claimed. ◻

</div>

Only the $`\mathrm M`$ and $`\mathrm R`$ formulas have the asserted small correction to a fixed affine map. To rewrite $`\mathrm U`$ in that form, let $`\gamma_n=r+o-2^{n+1}\ge0`$ be the excess of the actual adjacent spacing over its lower bound. Then
``` math
\lambda_{n+1}=2\lambda_n-2-
                   \frac{4\gamma_n+p^+}{2^{n+1}}\qquad(\mathrm U).
```
There is no $`O(n)`$ bound on $`\gamma_n`$ supplied by the separation inequality. At $`n=13`$, exact calculation gives
``` math
r=15147,\quad o=3997,\quad p^+=4,\quad
 \gamma_{13}=2760,\quad \mathrm{rem}(14)=392.
```
Thus $`\lambda_{14}-2\lambda_{13}+2=-2761/4096`$. In particular, the proposed uniform error bound $`|\delta_n|\le(2n+6)2^{-n}`$ in a three-branch signed-digit formula is false already at this row. The adjacent-spacing term cannot be absorbed into the divisor correction.

Iterating the $`\mathrm R`$ formula is still legitimate along a run of right branches. Its accumulated correction and endpoint indices must be retained in a reset estimate. These exact recurrences do not identify the proposed ceiling $`L_r<(r-3)/2`$ with a converse to the conditional reset square-root estimate.

The following values and finite ranges come from exact integer computations for the quotient-greedy sequence of Section <a href="#ssec:seam-model" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ssec:seam-model">5.4</a>. They provide test cases for the formulas above. The low-row remainders at $`n=14,15,32`$ are exact integer values.

*Use:* truncated weights define a different greedy problem, and the quotient-row construction uses integer weights rather than the original real weights. These are not automatically four readings of the same decision stream.

A certificate at one range does not transfer to another without such a theorem, and these reports do not decide the universal problem.

### Detailed results and their hypotheses

This section catalogues machinery for Erdős \#257 (is $`\sum_{n\in A} 1/(2^n-1)`$ irrational for every infinite $`A\subseteq\mathbb{N}_{\ge1}`$?) drawn from the half-membership route (is $`1/2`$ in the Mersenne achievement set?) and the support-rigidity / full-support route (irrationality of $`\sum_{a\in A} 1/(2^a-1)`$ for named families $`A`$). Every entry states exact hypotheses and an exact conclusion; the Lean proof of each is linked in the margin. None of these results decides \#257. Entries are grouped into **conditional implications** (with any unproved hypothesis identified) and **equivalences and exact identities** (including structural properties, definitions and exact finite values).

<a id="conditional-membership-tests"></a>

#### Conditional membership tests

The finite tests below use $`g_n=w_n-R_n`$. When written as functions, $`R(n)=R_n`$, $`g(n)=g_n`$, $`r(x,n)=r_n(x)`$ and $`C(A,N)=C_A(N)`$. For a finite set $`D`$, $`V(D)=X_D(2)`$. For $`n\ge2`$, the integer remainder $`s(n)=\mathrm{rem}(n)`$ uses weights $`q(2n,d)`$, $`2\le d<n`$, and target $`T_n=2^{2n-1}-2^n`$; it is not the real remainder $`r_n(1/2)`$. In the branch conditions below, $`D_s,B_s,o_s,p_s^-,p_s^+`$ denote the lower and upper supports, overshoot and correction terms of Theorem <a href="#thm:dynamics" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:dynamics">40</a>, with the row added as a subscript. The labels $`\mathrm U,\mathrm M,\mathrm R`$ mean precisely its three arithmetic cases.

**Theorem 44** (Infinitely many greedy skips force membership). *Fix $`x\ge0`$. If $`r_n(x)>R_n`$ at some rank $`n`$, every later rank is selected and $`r_{n+k}(x)>R_{n+k}`$ for every $`k\ge0`$. Consequently, infinitely many omitted positive ranks imply $`x\in\mathcal A`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* The identity $`R_n=w_{n+1}+R_{n+1}`$ gives $`r_n(x)>w_{n+1}`$, so the rule takes rank $`n+1`$ and leaves $`r_{n+1}(x)=r_n(x)-w_{n+1}>R_{n+1}`$. Induction proves persistence. Infinitely many skips therefore force $`0\le r_n(x)\le R_n`$ at every rank; since $`R_n\to0`$, the greedy sum equals $`x`$. ◻

**Theorem 45** (The quotient remainders converge to the greedy deficit). *Let $`G`$ be the real greedy support for $`1/2`$, and let $`D_s`$ be the integer-greedy support at row $`s`$. Then
``` math
X_{D_s}(2)\longrightarrow X_G(2),\qquad
 \frac{\mathrm{rem}(s)}{4^s}\longrightarrow
 \delta:=\frac12-X_G(2)\ge0.
```
In particular, the following conditions are equivalent: $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$; the full sequence $`\mathrm{rem}(s)/4^s`$ tends to zero; and there exist $`s_j\to\infty`$ with $`\mathrm{rem}(s_j)/4^{s_j}\to0`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* For each fixed $`d`$, the scaled weight $`4^{-s}q(2s,d)`$ tends to $`w_d`$, and the scaled target tends to $`1/2`$. The finite-prefix stability argument of Proposition <a href="#prop:one-orbit" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:one-orbit">191</a> therefore gives $`D_s\cap\{2,\ldots,K\}=G\cap\{2,\ldots,K\}`$ for all sufficiently large $`s`$, for each fixed $`K`$. At such rows,
``` math
\bigl|X_{D_s}(2)-X_G(2)\bigr|\le R_K.
```
First letting $`s\to\infty`$ and then $`K\to\infty`$ proves convergence of the values. This uses summability, not an unproved uniform rate of prefix agreement.

For $`s\ge5`$, put $`\Phi_s=\sum_{d\in D_s}\{4^s/(2^d-1)\}`$, so $`0\le\Phi_s<s-2`$. The quotient identity gives exactly
``` math
X_{D_s}(2)=\frac12-2^{-s}
            -\frac{\mathrm{rem}(s)}{4^s}+\frac{\Phi_s}{4^s}.
```
The two error terms tend to zero, proving the asserted limit. The real greedy sums never exceed $`1/2`$, so $`\delta\ge0`$. By strict tail separation, a support representing $`1/2`$ must agree with the greedy rule, as in Theorem <a href="#thm:greedy-survival-catalogue" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:greedy-survival-catalogue">78</a>. Thus membership is equivalent to $`\delta=0`$, which is also equivalent to a zero limit along any one sequence $`s_j\to\infty`$. ◻

Convergence itself is automatic; proving that its limit is zero is exactly the unresolved membership question.

Then $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$. The stronger bound $`r_n(1/2)\le2^{-(n+1)}`$ at the same skipped ranks also suffices.

*Unlike Theorem <a href="#thm:two-channel-cap" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:two-channel-cap">46</a>, this hypothesis concerns every positive rank, not only skipped ranks.

Then $`t\in\mathcal A`$. The supports need not agree at different depths: compactness, together with $`R_d\to0`$, supplies a limiting support.

Then at every row $`s\ge5`$,
``` math

```
The first hypothesis concerns only middle transitions. The second concerns only right transitions at which the old overshoot is at most $`2^s`$. Neither condition is asserted here for the whole sequence.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* At row $`5`$, $`D_5=\{2,4\}`$ and $`\mathrm{rem}(5)=71`$, whereas $`B_5=\{2,3\}`$ and $`o_5=7\le32`$. For the induction step use Theorem <a href="#thm:dynamics" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:dynamics">40</a>. The upper branch gives $`\mathrm{rem}(s+1)\le2^{s+1}`$. On a middle branch put $`c=4\,\mathrm{rem}(s)-p_s^--4`$. If $`c\le-4`$, the new remainder is $`2^{s+1}+c+4\le2^{s+1}`$. Otherwise the hypothesis forces $`c\ge0`$. Adding the terminal weight to the corrected lower word then exceeds the target by $`2^{s+1}-c>0`$, so the new minimal overshoot is at most $`2^{s+1}`$.

On a right branch, an old remainder at most $`2^s`$ gives a new remainder at most $`2^{s+1}`$ by the recurrence. In the other case the inductive hypothesis gives $`o_s\le2^s`$; the corrected upper word exceeds the new target by $`4o_s+p_s^+-2^{s+1}`$, which is positive and at most $`2^{s+1}`$ by the second assumption. ◻

</div>

This conclusion is a disjunction. It does not by itself give an upper bound for the remainder on rows where only the overshoot is small, and therefore is not by itself a membership criterion.

**Theorem 53** (Upper-reset dyadic-band escape, checked for $`13\le d\le30`$). *The upper-reset dyadic-band escape condition requires the following at every actual upper reset $`d\ge13`$: for every $`0\le j\le d`$, the reset charge avoids a linear-width band immediately below the dyadic power $`2^{d-j+1}`$ ($`2^{d-j+1}<\mathrm{resetCharge}`$ or $`\mathrm{resetCharge}+2(d+j)\le 2^{d-j+1}`$). Granted this, $`1/2\in

**Theorem 54** (Möbius-centred carry nonnegativity below $`1/2`$). *If $`1\notin A`$ and $`X_A(2)<1/2`$, then $`C_A(N)\ge0`$ for every $`N`$. Indeed,

The carry is an integer, so it is at least $`1`$; subtracting $`1`$ gives the asserted nonnegativity of the centred carry. The strict inequality and integrality are both needed in this argument. The statement is about the divisor counts $`c_A`$, not a new irrationality criterion.*

**Theorem 59** (Irrationality from divisible coefficient blocks). *Let $`b\ge2`$ be an integer and let $`c:\mathbb N\to\mathbb N`$ satisfy $`c(n)\le n`$ for every $`n`$. Suppose that for every integer $`q\ge1`$ there are nonnegative integers $`N,K,L,C`$, with $`K\le L`$, such that
``` math
\begin{aligned}
 b^r&\mid c(N+r) &&(1\le r\le K),\\
 \sum_{r=K+1}^{L}c(N+r)b^{L-r}&\le C,\\
 c(N+L+1+t)&>0 &&\text{for some integer }t\ge0,\\
 q(C+N+L+2)&<b^L.

Then $`\sum_{n\ge1}c(n)b^{-n}`$ is irrational.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Write $`x=\sum_{n\ge1}c(n)b^{-n}`$. Multiplication by $`b^N`$ makes the terms through $`N`$ integral. The first condition also makes the terms at $`N+1,\ldots,N+K`$ integral. Subtracting their sum leaves, for some integer $`z`$,
``` math
0<b^Nx-z=\sum_{r>K}\frac{c(N+r)}{b^r}
 \le\frac{C+N+L+2}{b^L}<\frac1q.
```
Positivity follows from the specified nonzero coefficient beyond $`L`$. The middle sum contributes at most $`C/b^L`$, while $`c(N+r)\le N+r`$ gives
``` math
\sum_{r>L}\frac{c(N+r)}{b^r}
 \le b^{-L}\left(\frac{N+L}{b-1}+\frac{b}{(b-1)^2}\right)
 \le\frac{N+L+2}{b^L}.

If $`x=p/q`$ were rational, the positive difference $`b^Nx-z`$ could not be smaller than $`1/q`$. ◻

A certificate at one precision is not enough: the same coefficient sequence must satisfy these conditions for every $`q`$. The positive-tail condition is essential; without it the zero sequence would satisfy the other conditions at every precision. The full-support theorem supplies such certificates for $`c=\tau`$. Their existence for $`c=\varphi`$ is not proved here. This is a limitation of this particular sufficient criterion, not a comparison of every approach to Problem 249.

**Theorem 66** (A formal dichotomy for signed periodic weights). *Let $`b\ge2`$ and $`m\ge1`$ be integers, and let $`w:\mathbb{N}_{>0}\to\mathbb{Z}`$ be $`m`$-periodic. Put
``` math
x=\sum_{a\ge1}\frac{w(a)}{b^a-1},\qquad
 c_w(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}w(d).
```
The cited formal argument gives the dichotomy that $`x`$ is irrational or $`b^kx\in\mathbb{Z}`$ for some integer $`k\ge0`$. It excludes the latter alternative if $`c_w`$ has one sign throughout and is nonzero at arbitrarily large indices. These sign assumptions concern $`c_w`$, not $`w`$. As noted above, Luca and Tachiya’s theorem already excludes the terminating alternative for every nonzero periodic $`w`$, without either sign restriction. The zero weight gives $`x=0`$.*

Every prime divisor $`\ell`$ of $`2^p-1`$ has multiplicative order $`p`$ for $`2`$ modulo $`\ell`$. Since $`p`$ is odd, $`2p\mid\ell-1`$; thus $`\ell>t`$. All prime factors of $`h_t`$ are at most $`t`$, so Theorem <a href="#thm:mersenne-channel-survival" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:mersenne-channel-survival">67</a> gives

The Lean proof of the bound uses natural-number division $`t/2`$, that is, $`\lfloor t/2\rfloor`$. The ceiling choice in the ordinary argument supplies the displayed real-exponent bound also when $`t`$ is odd. The Lean statement of the exact denominator uses an equivalent formula in its own numerator notation. Neither denominator growth nor that identity supplies an approximation-error estimate.

This cancellation does not conflict with irrationality of the full weighted series, which follows from Luca and Tachiya’s theorem \[lucatachiya2017, Theorem A, p. 139\].

**Theorem 71** (The Lambert-series identity for the Möbius function). *The absolutely convergent signed series satisfies
``` math
\sum_{d\ge1}\frac{\mu(d)}{2^d-1}=\frac12.

This classical identity is also recorded in \[duverneytachiya, Example 1.1, p. 4\]. Expand each denominator geometrically and interchange the absolutely convergent sums. The coefficient of $`2^{-n}`$ is $`\sum_{d\mid n}\mu(d)`$, equal to $`1`$ for $`n=1`$ and $`0`$ otherwise. This proves the identity. Its coefficients are $`-1,0,1`$, not indicators of a support; the identity therefore does not represent $`1/2`$ as a subseries with all coefficients in $`\{0,1\}`$.*

*Observation 73* (Dyadic safety need not survive a take). For a residual $`p/(2D)`$, taking rank $`b`$ subtracts $`w_b`$ and gives
``` math
\frac{p}{2D}-\frac1{2^b-1}
 =\frac{p(2^b-1)-2D}{2D(2^b-1)}.

The residual $`7/34`$ is at most $`2^{-2}`$. Taking rank $`3`$ leaves $`15/238`$, which is strictly between $`2^{-4}`$ and $`w_4=1/15`$. Thus rank $`4`$ is skipped but fails the dyadic safety test. The displayed numerator has increased from $`7`$ to $`15`$; that increase does not preserve safety.

The same failure occurs with an initial denominator containing all Mersenne denominators through rank $`7`$. With $`D=\operatorname{lcm}(3,7,15,31,63,127)=1240155`$, one has
``` math
\frac{12149}{2D}-\frac1{255}
 =\frac{41179}{2\cdot21082635}.

The initial residual is at most $`2^{-7}`$. After this rank-$`8`$ take, ranks $`9`$ and $`10`$ are skipped, but the new residual exceeds $`2^{-10}`$. The exact numerator of that dyadic excess is $`2^9\cdot41179-21082635=1013>0`$.

``` math
\frac12\in\mathcal A\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad

where $`G`$ is the greedy support for $`1/2`$. In the forward direction, finitely many skipped exponents would express the full Mersenne sum as $`1/2`$ plus a finite rational sum, contradicting Erdős’s full-support irrationality theorem. The reverse implication uses the greedy tail criterion: once a remainder exceeds the whole available tail, every later exponent is selected. Infinitely many skips exclude that failure. The equivalence does not establish that infinitely many skips actually occur.*

**Theorem 75** (Equivalent descriptions of half-membership). *Each of the following is equivalent to $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$:*

1.  *The integer-greedy sequence is not eventually always on branch $`\mathrm R`$.*

2.  *There are arbitrarily large $`s\ge5`$ with $`s\notin D_{s+1}`$.*

3.  *Upper or middle transitions occur at arbitrarily large rows.*

4.  *Some sequence $`s_j\to\infty`$ satisfies $`s_j\notin D_{s_j+1}`$ for every $`j`$.*

5.  *There are rows $`s_j\to\infty`$ and omitted ranks $`d_j\in\{2,\ldots,s_j-1\}\smallsetminus D_{s_j}`$ with $`d_j\to\infty`$.*

6.  *The positive ranks omitted by the real half-greedy rule form an infinite set.*

7.  *The real half-greedy rule has no last omitted positive rank.*

</div>

Items (1)–(4) differ only by the branch classification and the choice of a sequence of rows. Item (5) requires the omitted ranks themselves to tend to infinity, not merely their containing rows. The cited identification with the real greedy support supplies (6)–(7). These equivalences do not prove that any of the conditions holds.

**Lemma 77** (Each Mersenne weight exceeds its remaining tail). *For $`n\ge1`$, let $`w_n=(2^n-1)^{-1}`$ and $`R_n=\sum_{j>n}w_j`$. Then
``` math
R_n=w_{n+1}+R_{n+1},\qquad
 2^{-n}<R_n\le2w_{n+1}<w_n.
```
For the upper bound, compare each tail term with $`2^{1-j}w_{n+1}`$ at index $`n+j`$, $`j\ge1`$, and sum the geometric series. The last inequality follows by comparing $`2/(2^{n+1}-1)`$ with $`1/(2^n-1)`$. This strict term-versus-tail inequality is the separation hypothesis used in the greedy arguments.*

*It is not available for the totient weights $`\varphi(n)/2^n`$: the terms at indices $`4`$ and $`5`$ already sum to $`2/16+4/32=1/4=\varphi(3)/2^3`$, and the remaining tail is positive. A general strict-tail argument therefore cannot be transferred to that sequence without a different hypothesis or proof.*

If all inequalities hold, the nonnegative remainders tend to zero because $`R_n\to0`$, so the greedy partial sums converge to $`x`$.

then no support agreeing with $`u`$ through rank $`d`$ represents $`t`$: omitting $`d+1`$ leaves value at most the lower endpoint, while including it gives value at least the upper endpoint. Other length-$`d`$ prefixes have disjoint containing intervals by the first-difference argument using $`w_n>R_n`$. Since the displayed gap lies inside the interval for $`u`$, none of those prefixes can represent $`t`$ either. Thus a certified strict gap excludes every representation, not just one proposed continuation.*

``` math
3W_s(E_-)+3\cdot2^{s+1}+2\cdot4^{s-d}+4=3W_s(E_+).

The correction is independent of the common prefix $`u`$. For the integer-greedy rows $`s\ge5`$, a right transition preserves the largest omitted rank, whereas an upper or middle transition makes $`s`$ the largest omitted rank in the next row.*

\left\lfloor\frac{4^s}{2^e-1}\right\rfloor

Subtract the sum over $`d<e<s`$ from the term at $`d`$. The powers of $`2`$ leave $`2^{s+1}`$; the powers of $`4`$ leave $`(2\cdot4^{s-d}+4)/3`$. The common prefix $`u`$ cancels. The branch statements follow from the support updates in Theorem <a href="#thm:dynamics" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:dynamics">40</a>: the right branch appends $`s`$ to the lower word, and the other two branches omit $`s`$. ◻

For example, $`s=5`$, $`d=4`$ and $`u=\{2\}`$ give $`W_s(E_-)=341`$ and $`W_s(E_+)=409`$; the displayed identity is $`3\cdot341+204=3\cdot409`$. Both the factor $`3`$ on the right and the restriction $`2s<3d`$ are essential to this formula.

For $`j>j_*`$ the first alternative holds by maximality.

To see the contradiction, complete $`D_D`$ by all ranks greater than $`D`$. The resulting support $`B=D_D\cup\{D+1,D+2,\ldots\}`$ has $`X_B(2)<1/2`$ under the all-right assumption. The exact carry identity in the cited proof gives $`C_B(2D+1)=C_D+3`$. If $`C_D=-3`$, this is zero. The recurrence $`C_B(N+1)=2C_B(N)+1-c_B(N+2)`$ and nonnegativity from Theorem <a href="#thm:mobius-centred-nonneg" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:mobius-centred-nonneg">54</a> first force $`C_B(2D+2)=0`$: indeed $`2D+3\in B`$, so $`c_B(2D+3)\ge1`$. Next $`D+2,2D+4\in B`$ imply $`c_B(2D+4)\ge2`$, giving $`C_B(2D+3)<0`$, a contradiction. The stronger conclusion $`C_D\ge-2`$ is proved in Theorem <a href="#thm:cd-neg3-impossible" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:cd-neg3-impossible">258</a>.

**Lemma 88** (The signed position of a skipped greedy prefix). *Let $`s\ge5`$ be omitted by the real greedy support $`G`$, and put
``` math
H_s=G\cap\{2,\ldots,s-1\},\qquad
 f_s=\sum_{d\in H_s}\left\lfloor\frac{4^s}{2^d-1}\right\rfloor-T_s.
```
Exactly one of the following holds:
``` math
\begin{array}{lll}
 f_s<0:& H_s=D_s,& f_s=-\mathrm{rem}(s),\quad \mathrm{rem}(s)\ge1;\\
 f_s=0:& H_s=D_s,& \mathrm{rem}(s)=0;\\
 f_s>0:& H_s=B_s,& f_s=o_s.
 \end{array}
```
Thus the real greedy prefix is one of the two adjacent integer words. This classifies its signed distance $`f_s`$ from $`T_s`$; it does not exclude the negative case. Nor does it identify $`f_s`$ with the different coordinate $`C_s=4\mathrm{rem}(s)-p_s^- -4`$ used in the final-middle argument.*

``` math
b_i(m)+2u_i(m)=a_i(m)+u_i(m+1).

Let $`k,L\ge0`$ be integers. Suppose that at index $`k`$ the coefficients agree and $`b_1(k)-b_2(k)=1`$. Suppose also that both coefficients and bits agree at indices $`k+1,\ldots,k+L`$. Then
``` math
u_1(k+L+1)-u_2(k+L+1)
   =2^L\bigl(2(u_1(k)-u_2(k))+1\bigr).

The factor in parentheses is an odd integer. If the two terminal carries have absolute values at most $`B_1,B_2`$, respectively, then $`2^L\le B_1+B_2`$. For a common bound $`B`$ the conclusion is $`2^L\le2B`$, not $`2^L\le B`$. The formula follows by subtracting the two recurrences: the initial bit difference gives the odd factor, and each subsequent agreement doubles it. An application must supply the stated agreements and terminal bounds.*

Suppose that each linear functional $`\ell_j:V\to\mathbb Q`$ vanishes on $`\ker(\mathrm{ev})`$. Then $`v-\mathrm{ev}(v)e\in\ker(\mathrm{ev})`$ gives $`\ell_j(v)=\ell_j(e)\mathrm{ev}(v)`$. Consequently any finite evaluation matrix $`(\ell_j(v_i))_{i,j}`$ is an outer product and has rank at most one. Every square minor of order at least two therefore vanishes.

**Theorem 91** (Two-thirds band: exact localisation of post-take skip-unsafety). *Write a positive residual as $`1/R`$. A skipped rank $`k`$ passes the sufficient dyadic test precisely when $`R\ge2^k`$. Suppose a weight at rank $`b`$ is taken without exhausting the residual: with $`q=2^b-1`$, assume $`0<R<q`$. The new reciprocal residual is $`Rq/(q-R)`$. If the next take is at rank $`c\ge b+2`$, put $`m=2^{c-1}`$. The last skipped rank is dyadically unsafe exactly when
``` math
m-1<\frac{Rq}{q-R}<m,
 \quad\text{equivalently}\quad
 \frac{q(m-1)}{q+m-1}<R<\frac{qm}{q+m}.
```
Clearing the positive denominators proves the equivalence. The interval has width $`q^2/((q+m)(q+m-1))`$.*

*For a single skipped rank, $`c=b+2`$ and $`m=2q+2`$. The width is then $`q^2/((3q+1)(3q+2))<1/9`$, and the interval lies inside $`2q<3R<2q+2/3`$. In this single-skip case, the cited corollaries exclude integral $`R`$ and show that a reduced pre-take residual $`p/(2D)`$ with $`p,D,q`$ odd can be unsafe only if $`p\ge7`$. The latter conclusion uses the divisibility by $`4`$ of $`6D-2pq`$ under the unsafe-band inequalities.*

*These are local transition statements, not bounds on the actual half-greedy orbit. Dyadic safety is only sufficient for the current tail test. The odd-coprime data $`(p,D,b)=(17,41,3)`$ give an unsafe single-skip example; no conclusion that the half-greedy orbit avoids such data follows from the band calculation.*

**Theorem 92** (A weaker sufficient test against the remaining tail). *Let $`k,u,L`$ be positive integers, and put $`a=2L-(2^k-1)u`$. Suppose $`a>0`$, equivalently that $`\rho=u/(2L)<w_k`$ and the greedy rule skips weight $`w_k`$. The dyadic sufficient test $`\rho\le2^{-k}`$ is equivalent to $`u\le a`$. The weaker sufficient condition
``` math
2u\le3a
```
ensures $`\rho<R_k`$, by comparison with $`2^{-k}+(3\cdot4^k)^{-1}+(7\cdot8^k)^{-1}<R_k`$. This conclusion excludes a fatal tail-mass deficit at the current step; it does not assert that $`\rho`$ is representable by the remaining weights, or that all future greedy steps survive.*

*The containment of these sufficient conditions is strict even for valid rational data: $`(k,u,L,a)=(2,7,13,5)`$ gives $`1/4<7/26<R_2`$. In contrast, the scalar pair $`(u,a)=(3,2)`$ in the linked inequality lemma does not arise from integral $`L`$ under the present parity relation. Unit numerators are nonfatal at such a skipped step, since then $`a\ge1`$. Conversely, a fatal step requires $`3a<2u`$, hence $`u\ge2`$, or $`u\ge3`$ when $`u`$ is odd.*

n`$: the binary coefficient series $`X_c = \sum'_{n\ge 1} c(n)/2^n`$ is rational iff there exists a positive integer multiplier $`v`$ and an integer orbit $`u:\mathbb N\to\mathbb Z`$ satisfying the exact carry recurrence $`u(N{+}1)=2u(N)-v\cdot c(N{+}1)`$ together with the condition $`u(N)/2^N\to0`$. Every integer sequence satisfying both conditions obeys $`u(N) = v\cdot T_c(N)`$ exactly, where $`T_c(N)=\sum_{j\ge 1} c(N{+}j)/2^j`$ is the scaled tail. For each fixed $`v`$ there is at most one such sequence. Positivity of the orbit alone is deliberately *not* used as an equivalent criterion: a homogeneous $`2^N`$-scaled perturbation can be added to any orbit without breaking the recurrence, so the limit condition cannot be dropped. The choices $`c=c_A`$ for Problem 257 and $`c=\varphi`$ for Problem 249 both satisfy $`0\le c(n)\le n`$.

Write $`\operatorname{den}(x)`$ for the positive reduced denominator of a rational number $`x`$. If $`m\mid D`$ and $`\gcd(m,|a|)=1`$, then $`m\mid\operatorname{den}(a/D)`$. If $`C\mid D`$ and $`\gcd(C,|a|)=1`$, then
``` math
\frac{C}{\gcd(C,h)}\mid\operatorname{den}(ha/D).

Thus scaling may remove part of the guaranteed divisor. Indeed, reduction divides $`D`$ by $`\gcd(D,|a|)`$, so no prime power in $`m`$ can be lost. After scaling, a prime $`p\mid C`$ can lose at most $`v_p(h)`$ powers from the guaranteed divisor. This is a lower bound on the reduced denominator, not an equality: for $`D=12`$, $`C=6`$, $`a=1`$, $`h=2`$, it guarantees the divisor $`3`$, while the reduced denominator is $`6`$.

**Lemma 100** (Commuting prime-power differences). *For a function $`g:\mathbb N_{>0}\to\mathbb Z`$, a positive integer $`p`$ and an integer $`e\ge1`$, define
``` math
(\Delta_{p,e}g)(n)=g(p^en)-g(p^{e-1}n).

These operators commute. If $`p\ne q`$ are primes, $`e,f\ge1`$, $`A\subseteq\mathbb N_{>0}`$, $`n\ge1`$ and $`\gcd(n,pq)=1`$, then
``` math
(\Delta_{q,f}\Delta_{p,e}c_A)(n)
   =\sum_{d\mid n}\mathbf1_A(p^eq^fd).
```
Thus the mixed difference counts precisely the support elements whose $`p`$- and $`q`$-adic exponents are $`e`$ and $`f`$ in this divisor sum.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Expanding either order gives the same four terms:
``` math

 &g(p^eq^fn)-g(p^{e-1}q^fn)\\
 &\qquad{}-g(p^eq^{f-1}n)+g(p^{e-1}q^{f-1}n).

This commutation needs no primality or coprimality. For $`g=c_A`$, write each divisor of $`p^eq^fn`$ uniquely as $`p^iq^jd`$, with $`d\mid n`$, $`0\le i\le e`$ and $`0\le j\le f`$. The two differences cancel all terms except $`i=e`$, $`j=f`$. ◻

For $`A=\{12\}`$, $`p=2`$, $`e=2`$, $`q=3`$, $`f=1`$, $`n=1`$, the four counts are $`1,0,0,0`$, so the mixed difference is $`1`$. This coefficient identity alone does not transfer rationality through the subsequence operation $`g(n)\mapsto g(pn)`$.

The compactness/closedness argument (binary coding $`\to`$ Cantor space $`\to`$ continuous image) is a fully generic technique for characterizing the achievement set of *any* absolutely convergent digit-weighted series, not specific to Mersenne denominators ; reusable for a $`\varphi(n)/2^n`$ subsum set after checking summability. No separation of successive weights is needed for compactness or closedness; the stronger topological conclusions require their own hypotheses. Closedness alone is what powers every “limit of a sequence of achieved points is achieved” argument in this catalogue (e.g. Theorem <a href="#thm:seam-limit" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:seam-limit">45</a>, Theorem <a href="#thm:straddle-closed-set" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:straddle-closed-set">48</a>).*

**Theorem 103** (Nonmembership of one half and a finite fatal gap). *The value $`1/2`$ is not in $`\mathcal A`$ if and only if there are an integer $`d\ge0`$ and a finite set $`u\subseteq\{1,\ldots,d\}`$ such that
``` math
X_u(2)+R_{d+1}<\frac12<X_u(2)+w_{d+1}.
```
One implication is Lemma <a href="#lem:fatal-gap-exclusion" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:fatal-gap-exclusion">80</a>. For the other, follow the greedy prefixes: nonmembership forces a first failure of the tail inequality, hence one of these gaps. The endpoint equalities are excluded by Lemma <a href="#lem:half-endpoint-kills" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:half-endpoint-kills">81</a>.*

*A finite prefix and strict gap provide a nonmembership witness. The tail inequality can be certified by rational truncation bounds as in Theorem <a href="#thm:one-sided" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:one-sided">22</a>. Membership, in contrast, asserts that no such witness exists; failure to find one in a finite search is not a proof. The reduction uses $`w_n>R_n`$, not compactness alone. The totient weights fail this hypothesis, as the example after Lemma <a href="#lem:mersenne-tail-weight" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:mersenne-tail-weight">77</a> shows.*

**Definition 104** (Separated integer values and bounded perturbations). Let $`\alpha`$ be a set, let $`s:\alpha\to\mathbb{N}`$ be injective, and let $`p:\alpha\to\mathbb{N}`$. Suppose integers $`g\ge1`$ and $`B\ge0`$ satisfy
``` math
s(x)<s(y)\ \Longrightarrow\ s(x)+g\le s(y),
 \qquad 0\le p(x)\le B<3g.

The updated values are $`t(x)=4s(x)+p(x)`$. For a capacity $`C\ge0`$, an adjacent pair consists of $`x_-,x_+\in\alpha`$ with $`s(x_-)`$ the largest value at most $`C`$ and $`s(x_+)`$ the smallest value greater than $`C`$. Existence of both values is part of the assumption; it is not guaranteed for an arbitrary family. Set
``` math
r=C-s(x_-),\qquad o=s(x_+)-C,\qquad

The inequality $`B<3g`$ preserves the order of the updated values. The next result uses the stronger bound $`B<g`$ to ensure that the selected updated value is admissible at capacity $`4C+g`$. The linked structures encode these data.

**Theorem 105** (Perturbed-family maximality and the three-branch recurrence). *Use the family and adjacent pair of Definition <a href="#defn:perturbed-family" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="defn:perturbed-family">104</a>, and assume in addition that $`B<g`$. At capacity $`C'=4C+g`$, the largest admissible updated value is $`t(x_+)`$ if $`4o+p_+\le g`$, and $`t(x_-)`$ otherwise. After this choice, apply the take-if-possible rule to an additional weight $`W=2g+4`$. The resulting remainder is
``` math
\begin{cases}
 g-4o-p_+,&4o+p_+\le g,\\
 4r+g-p_-,&4o+p_+>g\ \text{and}\ 4r+g-p_-<W,\\
 4r-g-p_--4,&4o+p_+>g\ \text{and}\ 4r+g-p_-\ge W.
 \end{cases}
```*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* The lower candidate satisfies $`t(x_-)\le4C+B<C'`$, and $`t(x_+)\le C'`$ is exactly the test $`4o+p_+\le g`$. Order preservation excludes earlier values from improving the selected one. Any value after $`x_+`$ has $`s(x)\ge s(x_+)+g>C+g`$, and hence $`t(x)>C'`$. Thus no other candidate is missed.

On the first branch the remainder is at most $`g<W`$, so the extra weight is not taken. The other two branches compare the lower candidate’s remainder $`4r+g-p_-`$ with $`W`$. All displayed differences are nonnegative on their respective branches. ◻

</div>

The theorem describes a two-stage rule, not automatically the maximum of $`\{t(x)+\varepsilon W:x\in\alpha,\ \varepsilon\in\{0,1\}\}`$ below $`C'`$. For example, take old values $`4,5,7`$, $`g=1`$, $`B=0`$, $`p=0`$ and $`C=6`$. Then $`C'=25`$ and $`W=6`$. The rule chooses $`20`$ and cannot add $`6`$, but $`16+6=22`$ is a larger admissible extended value. A sufficient extra hypothesis for global maximality is $`4g-B\ge W`$: every earlier updated value plus $`W`$ is then at most the selected updated value. In the Mersenne application $`g=2^{s+1}`$, $`B=2(s-2)`$ and $`s\ge5`$, so this inequality holds. Thus the concrete recurrence is unaffected, but an application to another weight system must check this separation as well.

The hypothesis $`B<g`$ is additional; it does not follow from $`B<3g`$ in Definition <a href="#defn:perturbed-family" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="defn:perturbed-family">104</a>. The weaker bound alone does not ensure admissibility of the chosen value. Take $`g=2`$, $`B=3`$, old values $`0,2,4`$, perturbations $`0,3,0`$, and $`C=2`$. The rule selects the old value $`2`$, whose update is $`11>C'=10`$, although the updated value $`0`$ is admissible. This example explains why the stronger hypothesis must accompany the maximality statement.

#### Consequence theorems

This subsection concerns finite sets $`D`$ whose floor-quotient sums nearly represent $`1/2`$. Its main implication is elementary to state: if such finite sums approximate $`1/2`$ at unbounded depths with an error tending to zero, compactness supplies a representing support. The difficult input is the existence of the finite sets, not the final compactness argument. Definitions and conditional implications are separated below. An unproved hypothesis is not established merely because the implication using it has a formal proof.

The word “exact” refers to this integer equality, not to $`X_D(2)=1/2`$, which is impossible for finite $`D`$. The formal definition also allows $`n=0`$ using truncated natural-number subtraction. That degenerate case is immaterial to existence at unbounded depths.

**Theorem 110** (Compactness from exact finite sums). *Suppose the cofinal exact-row condition in Definition <a href="#record:257bm-d4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-d4">109</a> holds. Then $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$. For each $`N`$, choose an exact row $`D_N`$ at depth $`n_N\ge\max\{N,1\}`$. Proposition <a href="#record:257bm-i9" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i9">141</a> gives

       \le\frac{n_N+1}{2^{n_N}}\longrightarrow0.
```
Every $`X_{D_N}(2)`$ belongs to the closed set $`\mathcal A`$, so its limit does too. No finite support represents $`1/2`$; the representing support is therefore infinite. The proof does not require the chosen rows to be nested. The unproved input is their existence at unbounded depths.*

Then exact quotient rows exist at unbounded depths, and $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$. A single such skip at $`c`$ gives an exact row at depth $`2c-2`$ without an additional capacity hypothesis.

**Theorem 112** (A compatible family of finite supports). *Let $`b_{n,d}\in\{0,1\}`$ satisfy $`b_{n+1,d}=b_{n,d}`$ whenever $`2d\le n`$. Define
``` math
E_n=\{d:2\le d\le n,\ b_{n,d}=1\},\qquad
 D_n=E_n\cap\{2,\ldots,\lfloor n/2\rfloor\}.
```
The four conditions on the finite rows, required for every $`n\ge2`$, are
``` math
\begin{aligned}
 2^{\max\{c_{D_n}(n)-1,0\}}-1&\le S(D_n,1,n-1),\\
 \sum_{\substack{d\in E_n\\d>\lfloor n/2\rfloor}}2^{n-d}

 H(D_n,1,n)&<2^{n-\lfloor n/2\rfloor},\\
 Q(E_n,n)&=2^{n-1}-1.
 \end{aligned}
```
The first condition implies that the integer in the next two lines is nonnegative. The second specifies the binary value of the upper half of the row, the third bounds that value by its available number of bits, and the fourth is the exact quotient equation. The maximum in the first line records natural-number subtraction at the case $`c_{D_n}(n)=0`$.*

*These are the finite hypotheses of the compatible-limit construction. The bit condition fixes coordinate $`d`$ from row $`2d`$ onward. Unlike the independent finite supports in Definition <a href="#record:257bm-d4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-d4">109</a>, the rows therefore have a prescribed common limit. This extra structure is not, by itself, a proof of strictness between the corresponding existence statements.*

The existence of rows satisfying these four conditions for every $`n\ge2`$ is not proved.

**Theorem 117** (A later skip after a selected block). *Suppose the real half-greedy rule skips rank $`c`$, takes $`c+1,\ldots,c+t-1`$, and skips $`c+t`$. If
``` math
0<t\le c-3,\qquad c-2\le2^{c-t-3},
```
then the precritical suffix bound at $`c`$ holds. It yields sharp capacity and hence an exact row at depth $`2c-2`$. The case $`t=1`$ includes Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-c6a" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-c6a">116</a>; the proof also permits longer selected blocks. The arithmetic condition is precisely $`t\le c-3-\lceil\log_2(c-2)\rceil`$. Its role in the proof is to make the dyadic allowance $`2^{c-t-3}`$ cover the bound $`|D|\le c-2`$ for the earlier selected support.*

*To obtain cofinal exact rows by this result, the stated gap condition must hold at cofinally many skipped ranks $`c`$, not just at one rank or throughout a finite sample. A finite empirical skip frequency alone gives no such pointwise gap bound.*

**Theorem 122** (Testing one nearest dyadic boundary). *Let $`d,E`$ be nonnegative integers with $`E\le2^{d+1}`$, and let
``` math
j_*:=\max\{0\le j\le d:E\le2^{d-j+1}\}.
```
The boundary $`2^{d-j_*+1}`$ is the smallest power at least $`E`$ among the finite list $`2,4,\ldots,2^{d+1}`$; in particular $`j_*=d`$ when $`E\le2`$. The following conditions are equivalent:
``` math
\begin{gathered}
 \text{for every }0\le j\le d,\quad
 2^{d-j+1}<E\ \text{or}\ E+2(d+j)\le2^{d-j+1};\\
 E+2(d+j_*)\le2^{d-j_*+1}.
 \end{gathered}
```*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* For $`j>j_*`$ the boundary is below $`E`$; for $`j<j_*`$ the boundary is larger and the required width $`2(d+j)`$ is smaller. This proves sufficiency of the single inequality; necessity is its instance at $`j_*`$. ◻

For example, $`d=5`$, $`E=20`$ gives $`j_*=1`$ and $`20+12=32`$, so equality at the allowed edge satisfies every band condition.

At an actual upper reset, Proposition <a href="#record:257bm-c12" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-c12">123</a> supplies $`E\le2^{d+1}`$.

**Proposition 123** (An upper bound for the reset expression). *Let $`d\ge5`$ be an actual upper-reset row. Write $`E_d`$ for its reset charge, the sum of four times the adjacent upper overshoot and the corresponding nonnegative correction term. The upper-reset identity is
``` math
\mathrm{rem}(d+1)+E_d=2^{d+1}.

The nonnegativity of the successor remainder therefore gives $`E_d\le2^{d+1}`$, the side condition needed for Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-c11" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-c11">122</a>.

This condition is equivalent to Definition <a href="#record:257bm-c13" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-c13">124</a>. At an actual skipped rank, the source proves that $`F(n-1,n)<0`$ holds exactly when the real prefix agrees with the integer greedy word and its integer remainder is positive. On agreement, $`F(n-1,n)`$ is the negative of that nonnegative remainder. Thus nonnegativity of the margin at every skip is equivalent to vanishing of the remainder at every aligned skip. The equivalence is proved; neither condition is established for all required ranks.*

**Theorem 130** (An eventual nonnegative margin suffices). *Fix a positive depth $`k`$ and put $`D=G\cap\{2,\ldots,k\}`$. The following conditions are equivalent:
``` math
r_k(1/2)<2^{-(k+1)}

Here $`F_k(J)`$ is the integer expression defined in Theorem <a href="#thm:frozen-margin" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:frozen-margin">56</a>. Its normalised value is
``` math
2^{-J}F_k(J)=\sum_{i=1}^{J}c_D(k+1+i)2^{-i}-C_D(k).

This normalised expression, not necessarily $`F_k(J)`$ itself, is nondecreasing in $`J`$. Its limit is $`1-2^{k+1}r_k(1/2)`$, by the finite-support Lambert identity. This is positive exactly under the strict dyadic inequality on the left. At positive $`k`$, oddness of the reduced excess numerator excludes equality at zero.*

*The result supplies some finite horizon, not the horizon $`J=c-3`$ required in the crossing application. More quantitatively, write $`\eta=1-2^{k+1}r_k(1/2)>0`$. Since $`\sum_{r\ge1}c_D(m+r)2^{-r}\le m+2`$, the omitted tail shows that $`(k+J+3)2^{-J}<\eta`$ suffices for $`F_k(J)>0`$. The value $`\eta`$ is rational for the finite support $`D`$, so this is an effective sufficient test. Proving it at the prescribed horizon is a separate arithmetic obligation.*

**Theorem 132** (The next floor quotient). *For $`d\ge2`$ and $`M\ge0`$, the floor quotient satisfies
``` math
q(M+1,d)=2q(M,d)+\mathbf1_{d\mid M+1}.
```
Indeed, $`q(M,d)=\sum_{j=1}^{\lfloor M/d\rfloor}2^{M-jd}`$. Increasing $`M`$ doubles each existing term and adds $`1`$ exactly when $`M+1`$ is divisible by $`d`$. Thus a quotient doubles or doubles plus one; it does not remain unchanged except when both values are zero. Summing over a fixed finite support gives the corresponding update with added term $`c_D(M+1)`$.*

**Theorem 134** (The signed endpoint recurrence). *The signed next-step expression is $`H(D,k,n)=2S(D,k,n-1)+1-c_D(n)`$. The last term counts the selected exponents dividing the new endpoint.

**Theorem 136** (Equivalent forms of the sharper bound). *Under the hypotheses of Definition <a href="#record:257bm-i-cap" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i-cap">135</a>:
``` math
\ensuremath{S}(D,1,2c-2) < 2^{c-2} \;\Longleftrightarrow\; 2^{(2c-2)-1} \le \ensuremath{Q}(D\cup\{c\},\ 2c-2).
```
The threshold on the right is one greater than the exact-row target $`2^{2c-3}-1`$. Thus this is a test for omitting rank $`c`$, not for including it in the completed row.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Put $`M=2c-2`$. Since $`X_D(2)<1/2`$, one has $`Q(D,M)<2^{M-1}`$, and the integer remainder is $`S(D,1,M)=2^{M-1}-Q(D,M)-1\ge0`$ without truncation. The geometric quotient identity gives $`q(M,d)=2^{M-d}`$ for $`c\le d\le M`$, since $`2d>M`$. In particular $`q(M,c)=2^{c-2}`$, so
``` math
S(D,1,M)<2^{c-2}
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 Q(D\cup\{c\},M)\ge2^{M-1}.
```
For the completion, use the ranks $`c+1,\ldots,M`$ instead. Their quotient weights are $`2^{c-3},\ldots,1`$ and represent every integer from $`0`$ to $`2^{c-2}-1`$. A subset of them therefore has quotient sum $`S(D,1,M)`$ and completes $`D`$ to the exact target $`2^{M-1}-1`$ while omitting $`c`$. These finite identities prove the equivalence and explain the sharper bound. They do not assert that a completed row stays below one half in real value. ◻

</div>

For example, $`D=\{2,3\}`$ and $`c=5`$ give $`M=8`$, $`Q(D,8)=121`$ and remainder $`6<8`$. Inserting rank $`5`$ adds $`8`$, giving $`129`$ rather than the exact target $`127`$. The correct completion adds ranks $`6`$ and $`7`$, whose quotients are $`4`$ and $`2`$.

**Theorem 137** (An unconditional bound with one extra bit). *Unconditionally, for every $`c\ge4`$ and every below-half core $`D\subseteq[2,c)`$ with deficit $`<\ensuremath{w}(c)`$:
``` math
\ensuremath{S}(D,1,2c-2) < 2^{c-1}.
```
The bound holds uniformly in $`c`$, but is twice the threshold needed in Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-i5" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i5">136</a> to apply Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-c7" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-c7">118</a>. Before using $`|D|\le c-2\le2^{c-2}`$, the proof gives the sharper additive estimate $`\ensuremath{S}(D,1,2c-2)<2^{c-2}+|D|`$. Thus the critical-capacity inequality would follow by excluding the integer band $`[2^{c-2},\,2^{c-2}+c-3]`$, which contains $`c-2`$ integers. This is the same band shape as Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-c11" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-c11">122</a>’s dyadic-band condition. Its width is linear in $`c`$, whereas the square-root reset condition discussed in Section <a href="#sec:o4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:o4">12.5</a> has width $`2^{(r+5)/2}`$ in a different parameter $`r`$. Comparing these widths alone proves no implication between the two hypotheses.*

##### Doubling the endpoint

<div id="record:257bm-i7" class="thm">

**Theorem 138** (The binary bound after doubling). *Let $`n\ge6`$ and $`D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,n\}`$ satisfy $`2\in D`$, $`Q(D,n)=2^{n-1}-1`$, and $`X_D(2)<1/2`$. Then
``` math
S(D,1,2n-1)<2^{n-1}.
```
The missing quotient can therefore be filled using only the ranks $`n+1,\ldots,2n-1`$, without changing $`D`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Write $`F_M=\sum_{d\in D}\{2^M/(2^d-1)\}`$ and $`P=2^{n-1}`$. The exact row at $`n`$ gives $`2^n(1/2-X_D(2))=1-F_n`$. At $`M=2n-1`$ this becomes
``` math
S(D,1,2n-1)=P(1-F_n)+F_{2n-1}-1.
```
The below-half assumption makes this an ordinary integer difference, so no truncation is needed. Since $`2\in D`$, one has $`F_n\ge1/3`$; also $`F_{2n-1}\le|D|\le n-1`$. Therefore
``` math
S(D,1,2n-1)\le\frac23P+n-2<P,
```
using $`3(n-2)<2^{n-1}`$ for $`n\ge6`$. The ranks $`n+1,\ldots,2n-1`$ supply exactly $`n-1`$ binary digits, with total capacity $`2^{n-1}-1`$. The binary expansion of the nonnegative missing quotient gives the required extension. ◻

</div>

For example, $`n=6`$ and $`D=\{2,3,6\}`$ give $`X_D(2)=31/63`$, $`Q(D,11)=1006`$ and missing quotient $`1023-1006=17`$. The ranks $`7`$ and $`11`$ supply $`16+1`$. The resulting exact row $`E=\{2,3,6,7,11\}`$ has $`X_E(2)-1/2=13955/32756094>0`$. Thus the extension is exact at its integer target, but need not remain below half in real value.

**Theorem 143** (Small remainder forces the greedy word). *Let $`g\ge1`$ and let $`w_1,\ldots,w_m`$ be nonnegative integer weights satisfying
``` math
w_i\ge g+\sum_{j>i}w_j\qquad(1\le i\le m).
```
Fix an integer capacity $`C\ge0`$. The greedy word $`\gamma`$ is obtained by taking $`w_i`$ exactly when it does not exceed the remaining capacity. For an admissible Boolean word $`\varepsilon`$, meaning $`\sum_i\varepsilon_iw_i\le C`$, one has
``` math
C-\sum_i\varepsilon_iw_i<g
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 \varepsilon=\gamma\ \text{and}\
 C-\sum_i\gamma_iw_i<g.
```
Indeed, two different words have sums separated by at least $`g`$, as seen at their first differing index; the greedy sum is the largest admissible sum. Thus there is at most one admissible word with remainder below $`g`$, and any such word is greedy. The greedy word alone need not have remainder below $`g`$: for weights $`(5)`$, gap $`g=2`$ and capacity $`C=3`$, its remainder is $`3`$.*

Indeed, $`c(N+r)\le N+r`$, while $`\sum_{r\ge1}2^{-r}=1`$ and $`\sum_{r\ge1}r2^{-r}=2`$. Thus the scaled tail is $`O(N)`$, and in particular $`o(2^N)`$, as required in Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-i-t7" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i-t7">148</a>.

**Theorem 148** (Rationality through an integer recurrence). *Let $`c:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}`$ satisfy $`c(n)\le n`$ for every $`n`$. Then $`\sum_{n\ge1}c(n)2^{-n}`$ is rational if and only if there exist a positive integer $`v`$ and a sequence $`u:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{Z}`$ such that
``` math
u(N+1)=2u(N)-v c(N+1)\quad(N\ge0),\qquad
 \frac{u(N)}{2^N}\longrightarrow0.
```
The limit condition is $`u(N)=o(2^N)`$; it does not assume that $`u`$ is bounded. No divisor-count hypothesis is imposed on $`c`$. Thus the ordinary statement also applies to $`c=\varphi`$; the identification with the separate formal \#249 development, including its indexing conventions, is not asserted here.*

</div>

The equivalence follows by telescoping the recurrence:
``` math
\frac{u(N)}{2^N}=u(0)-v\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{c(n)}{2^n}.
```
The limit condition gives the rational value $`u(0)/v`$. Conversely, if the series equals $`p/v`$, define $`u(N)=2^Np-v\sum_{n=1}^N2^{N-n}c(n)`$. This is an integer and equals $`v\sum_{r\ge1}c(N+r)2^{-r}`$, so the preceding tail bound proves the limit. This argument also explains why an arbitrary integer solution of the recurrence is insufficient: its homogeneous part can grow like $`2^N`$.

For example, the finite support $`A=\{2\}`$ has $`c_A(n)=\mathbf1_{2\mid n}`$ and $`X_A(2)=1/3`$. With $`v=3`$, the sequence $`u(N)=1`$ for even $`N`$ and $`u(N)=2`$ for odd $`N`$ satisfies the recurrence. The criterion therefore includes finite supports; it does not provide the infinite support needed to contradict Problem 257.

**Theorem 151** (A restriction on dyadic rational values). *If an infinite support $`A\subseteq\mathbb{N}_{>0}`$ has $`X_A(2)=p/2^c`$ for integers $`p`$ and $`c\ge0`$, then $`\sum_{a\in A}1/a`$ either diverges or converges to a value greater than $`1`$. The cited proof averages the shifted integer recurrence and uses a common multiple of two distinct support elements. Thus a convergent reciprocal sum of at most $`1`$ is excluded. This is a separate necessary condition: the reciprocal-summable criterion proved earlier already excludes every support with a convergent reciprocal sum, not just those whose sum is at most $`1`$.*

**Theorem 152** (Unboundedness of a positive shifted recurrence). *Let $`A\subseteq\mathbb{N}_{>0}`$ be infinite, fix a shift $`c\ge0`$ and a positive integer $`v`$, and let $`u`$ be a positive integer sequence satisfying
``` math
u(n+1)+v c_A(c+n+1)=2u(n)\qquad(n\ge0).

Then $`u`$ is unbounded. Indeed, under a proposed bound $`u(n)\le B`$, choose $`2B+1`$ distinct support elements and a common multiple larger than $`c`$. At the corresponding index the divisor count is at least $`2B+1`$, contradicting the recurrence.

**Theorem 153** (Bounds for intervals with zero divisor counts). *Suppose that $`X_A(2)=p/(2^cv)`$ for an infinite positive support $`A`$ and an odd positive integer $`v`$. For every $`\varepsilon>0`$ there is $`B`$ such that, for $`N\ge1`$, a run of $`h`$ zero divisor counts starting after $`c+N`$ satisfies $`h\le\varepsilon\log_2N+B`$. In fact this conclusion holds without rationality: fix any $`a\in A`$. Every $`a`$ consecutive positive integers include a multiple of $`a`$, where $`c_A`$ is positive. Hence $`h\le a-1`$, so one can take $`B=a-1`$. The zero-run conclusion therefore imposes no additional restriction on a fixed nonempty support, regardless of the tail estimates used in the linked proof.*

The constant absorbs the finitely many primes below $`2^k`$; for larger primes, $`(\nu+1)^k\le p^\nu`$ controls each factor of the divisor product.

``` math
\sum_{n>N}g_n\le\frac29\,4^{-N}+\frac37\,8^{-N},

Indeed, the finite sum from $`N+1`$ to $`M`$ telescopes to $`2^N R_N-2^M R_M`$, and $`2^M R_M\to1`$. The final bound uses $`R_N\le2^{-N}+(2/3)4^{-N}`$. Disjointness follows from the strict-tail construction of the achievement set. This is an ordinary geometric deduction, not the statement of the preceding linked gap-sum lemma.

**Theorem 163** (A sufficient inequality for a safe skip). *Let $`k,u,L\ge1`$ be integers, set $`a=2L-(2^k-1)u`$, and suppose $`a>0`$. For the skipped rational remainder $`\rho=u/(2L)`$, $`\rho\le2^{-k}`$ is equivalent to $`u\le a`$, whereas
``` math
2u\le3a\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\rho<R_k.
```
The latter implication uses the three-term lower bound above. More explicitly, with $`t=2^k\ge2`$,
``` math
\left(\frac1t+\frac1{3t^2}+\frac1{7t^3}\right)
       -\frac3{3t-1}
 =\frac{2t-3}{21t^3(3t-1)}>0.
```
The inequality $`2u\le3a`$ gives $`\rho\le3/(3t-1)`$, proving the claim. The first two terms alone would not prove this comparison. This is a sufficient exclusion of the current tail-mass deficit, not an exact test for membership in the remaining achievement set.*

*The sufficient condition is weaker than $`u\le a`$. A realizable example is $`(k,u,L,a)=(2,7,13,5)`$; it passes $`2u\le3a`$ but not $`u\le a`$. The linked scalar example $`(u,a)=(3,2)`$ proves strict containment of the inequalities, but is not integral rational data for this substitution. For comparison, the exact mass threshold is $`a/u\ge R_k^{-1}-(2^k-1)`$; its right-hand side lies strictly between $`0`$ and $`2/3`$. None of these comparisons asserts that the half-greedy orbit satisfies the sufficient inequality at every skipped rank.*

**Theorem 165** (Two-sided dyadic bounds). *Under the local hypothesis excluding the specified three middle cells and imposing the right-pulse bound, induction (base case at row 5 verified by direct computation) propagates it to the universal two-sided bound
``` math
\forall s\ge5,\quad \min(\mathrm{rem}(s),\ \mathrm{overshoot}(s)) \;\le\; 2^s.
```
This conditional bound says that at least one of the remainder and the adjacent overshoot is at most $`2^s`$. It does not assert that both are at most $`2^s`$; that stronger assertion would replace the minimum by a maximum. It is not needed for the charge bound at an actual upper reset: Proposition <a href="#record:257bm-c12" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-c12">123</a> obtains that bound directly from the upper-reset identity.

``` math
2^{d-j+1}<\mathrm{resetCharge}

\mathrm{resetCharge}+2(d+j)\le2^{d-j+1}.
```
It computes the successor remainder at each row $`d+1`$, from $`\mathrm{rem}(14)=392`$ through $`\mathrm{rem}(31)=4187487147`$. This proves the required condition on a finite range, not the universal condition for all $`d\ge13`$. A proof for unbounded reset indices must supply a further argument; repeatedly extending the table alone does not establish that statement.*

**Theorem 167** (A general perturbed greedy recurrence). *Let the old integer values be separated by at least $`g\ge1`$, and let the update be $`t(x)=4s(x)+p(x)`$ with $`0\le p(x)\le B<g`$. Suppose $`x_-`$ and $`x_+`$ are the adjacent old values on either side of capacity $`C`$.

*The underlying structure in Definition <a href="#defn:perturbed-family" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="defn:perturbed-family">104</a> assumes only $`B<3g`$; that suffices for order preservation, but the cited maximality application has the additional hypothesis $`B<g`$.

**Theorem 168** (Spacing of compatible reverse-carry words). *Consider two integer carry recurrences $`b_i(m)+2u_i(m)=a_i(m)+u_i(m+1)`$, $`i=1,2`$. If $`a_1(k)=a_2(k)`$ and the output bits at $`k`$ are $`1`$ and $`0`$, then the carry difference at $`k+1`$ is odd. If the coefficients and bits agree for the following $`L`$ positions, the difference at $`k+L+1`$ is $`2^L`$ times that odd integer. Consequently absolute terminal bounds $`B_1,B_2`$ give $`2^L\le B_1+B_2`$. Lemma <a href="#lem:reverse-carry-word" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:reverse-carry-word">89</a> states the exact identity and proves it by subtraction.

#### Obstructions and countermodels

The results below test particular proposed implications. A countermodel to an abstract transition rule shows that the rule needs an additional hypothesis; it does not disprove a more structured arithmetic argument. Each entry states the information retained by its model and the conclusion that this information fails to imply.

**Theorem 170** (A bounded model of the doubling-or-return alternative). *The dichotomy $`\mathrm{ExactLocalMersenneHalfRow}(2n{-}1) \vee \exists c,\,4\le c\le n\wedge
\mathrm{ExactLocalMersenneHalfRow}(2c{-}2)`$ (proved for $`n\ge6`$ at Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-k-dich" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-k-dich">171</a> below) is not by itself enough for cofinality. Countermodel: $`\mathrm{boundedDoubleOrRecycleModel}(n) := (n=6)`$ satisfies exactly the same two-branch transition shape (seed at 6, and the model reproduces the $`\vee`$ shape by always taking the recycle branch with $`c=4`$, conclusion back at $`2\cdot4-2=6`$), yet
``` math
\neg\big(\forall N,\ \exists n\ge N,\ \mathrm{boundedDoubleOrRecycleModel}(n)\big) \qquad \text{(not cofinal ;  only ever true at } n=6\text{)}.
```
The double-or-recycle transition shape, even together with an endpoint-six seed, is logically insufficient to conclude cofinal exact rows. A genuinely new progress input (strict endpoint growth, or an independent cofinality argument) is required. The countermodel retains only the seed and this transition rule. It therefore tests those premises, not additional arithmetic information that a more structured induction may use.*

**Theorem 171** (Doubling or returning to an earlier depth). *For $`n\ge6`$, $`\mathrm{ExactLocalMersenneHalfRow}(n)`$:
``` math
\mathrm{ExactLocalMersenneHalfRow}(2n-1) \;\vee\; \exists c,\ 4\le c\le n \wedge \mathrm{ExactLocalMersenneHalfRow}(2c-2).
```
Every exact row of depth at least $`6`$ has at least one of the two asserted continuations. The proof separates the below-half case from the above-half case, but the two existential conclusions need not be exclusive. The returned depth $`2c-2`$ is not claimed to exceed $`n`$. The finite Mersenne value cannot equal $`1/2`$, by Observation <a href="#record:257bm-k11" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-k11">181</a>; this says nothing about equality of the returned and original depths. For example, at $`n=6`$, the support $`\{2,3,6\}`$ is an exact row, and so is $`\{2,3,6,7,11\}`$ at depth $`11`$. The second conclusion also holds with $`c=4`$, since $`2c-2=6`$. Thus both conclusions hold in this example, and the second allows no depth increase. What is missing, per Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-k1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-k1">170</a>, is not another dichotomy but strict endpoint progress in the recycle branch, or a proof the below-half branch recurs ; re-deriving this disjunction without an additional progress argument would not establish cofinality.*

**Proposition 172** (A sufficient fractional-mass bound need not hold). *Take $`D=\{2,3\}`$ and $`c=5`$. Direct calculation gives
``` math
X_D(2)=\frac{10}{21}<\frac12
 <\frac{331}{651}=X_{D\cup\{5\}}(2),\qquad S(D,1,8)=6<8.
```
However, the combined fractional mass is
``` math
\sum_{d\in D\cup\{5\}}\frac{2^8\bmod(2^d-1)}{2^d-1}
 =\frac{757}{651}>1.
```
The linked Lean proof checks this example by direct computation. Thus the combined fractional-mass bound by $`1`$, which suffices for the sharp capacity estimate, is not necessary for that estimate. Thus the fractional-mass bound cannot hold at every real crossing core. A proof using it would need to handle the exceptional cores separately; the example does not rule out all uses of fractional-mass estimates. Theorem <a href="#record:257rig-k6" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257rig-k6">176</a> identifies the support at a critical crossing with a real greedy prefix, but does not prove the missing bound on those prefixes.*

From the identity $`\mathrm{value}(E)-\tfrac12 = \big(\mathrm{localFractionMass}(E,2n{-}1)-1\big)/2^{2n-1}`$, at the seed $`D=\{2,3,6\}`$ (Definition <a href="#record:257bm-i-seed" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i-seed">140</a>) with $`M=11`$ the core alone contributes
``` math
\frac{2^{11}\bmod3}{3} + \frac{2^{11}\bmod7}{7} + \frac{2^{11}\bmod63}{63} = \frac23+\frac47+\frac{32}{63} \approx 1.746 > 1,
```
so the doubled row is strictly above half. Iterating the cheap (doubling) arm is therefore impossible from the only recorded seed; the chain is forced into the capacity-gated recycle arm at step one. What would close the doubling route instead: cofinally many below-half exact rows, $`\forall N\ \exists n\ge N\ \exists D`$ exact at $`n`$ with $`\mathrm{localFractionMass}(D,n)<1`$; a single such row at each of cofinally many $`n`$ would make doubling unnecessary; a self-reproducing one would close everything.

Thus $`D=G\cap\{1,\ldots,c-1\}`$: at a critical crossing the support is fixed by $`c`$.

**Theorem 179** (Vanishing of the specified linear-channel determinant). *Let $`V`$ be a vector space over $`\mathbb{Q}`$, let $`e:V\to\mathbb{Q}`$ be linear, and let $`(\ell_j)_{j\in\iota}`$ be a finite family of linear functionals vanishing on $`\ker e`$. For any vectors $`(v_i)_{i\in\iota}`$, the matrix $`(\ell_j(v_i))_{i,j\in\iota}`$ has rank at most one, so every square minor of size at least two vanishes. Indeed, the functionals descend to $`V/\ker e`$, which has dimension at most one. This elementary linear-algebra argument applies at every matrix size. It does not cover additional functionals that fail to vanish on $`\ker e`$.*

*Observation 180* (The additive error in the binary bound). Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-i6" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i6">137</a>’s $`2^{c-1}`$ bound and Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-i5" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i5">136</a>’s sharp $`2^{c-2}`$ requirement differ by one bit, and the proof of the loose bound shows exactly where: it derives $`A<2^{c-2}+|D|`$ and discards $`|D|\le c-2\le2^{c-2}`$. Under this additive upper bound, the remaining assertion is that the integer suffix avoids $`[2^{c-2},\,2^{c-2}+c-3]`$. This identifies the unresolved interval; it does not prescribe how to exclude it. A sharper estimate, an arithmetic restriction on the suffix, or another argument could in principle establish the required inequality.

#### Further finite and conditional results

This subsection records further finite identities and conditional membership results. They concern the middle transition, finite families with a common prefix, and rational targets other than $`1/2`$. Their hypotheses are stated separately from the existence assertions still needed to apply them.

<a id="the-integer-update-in-a-middle-interval"></a>

##### The integer update in a middle interval

The following identities explain the two-sided bound and the reset-band condition used above. They also distinguish the signed middle coordinate $`C_s=4\,\mathrm{rem}(s)-p_s^- -4`$ from the nonnegative label in the next estimate.

<div id="prop:unsafe-middle-range-exactly-three" class="prop">
<p class="evidence-marks"><a href="https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/c91562bd574a387cde904481e609c7b4cacebb14/lean/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/PaperCompleteR21/LinearChannelAndMiddleCellExclusion.lean#L83">Lean</a> · <a href="https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/c75e491ca57b70ba3a2b5a418c7acd49a53d8dfe/evidence/erdos257-mersenne-reasoning-surface/section-6-4.md#prop-unsafe-middle-range-exactly-three-comparator">Comparator</a></p>

**Proposition 183** (The unsafe middle range is exactly three integers). *For $`s\ge5`$, write $`R=\mathrm{rem}(s)`$ and $`P=p_s^-`$. Since $`4R-P-4`$ is an integer,
``` math
\neg(4R-P-4\le-4\ \vee\ 0\le 4R-P-4)\ \Longleftrightarrow\ 4R-P-4\in\{-3,-2,-1\}
```*

</div>

The complement of the two safe integer ranges is precisely $`\{-3,-2,-1\}`$. The conclusion is only a classification; excluding any of these values requires an additional argument.

For a row $`s\ge5`$, set
``` math
E_s=\sum_{d\in D_s}\left\{\frac{4^s}{2^d-1}\right\},\qquad
 Z_s=\mathrm{rem}(s)-E_s,\qquad
 c=4\,\mathrm{rem}(s)-p_s^-=C_s+4.
```
Here braces denote fractional part. Assume $`c\ge0`$, as in the linked statements below. In particular, the exceptional signed values $`C_s=-3,-2,-1`$ correspond to $`c=1,2,3`$, not to negative labels. The floor-quotient recurrence gives $`p_s^-\le4E_s`$, and hence
``` math
4Z_s\le c.
```
This inequality has a Lean proof ([`seamMiddleCell_four_mul_floorZ_le`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4142)). On a middle transition $`D_{s+1}=D_s`$. Writing $`\rho=1/2-X_{D_s}(2)`$, the exact quotient identity therefore gives
``` math
4^{s+1}\rho=2^{s+2}+4Z_s\le2^{s+2}+c,
```
also proved in Lean ([`seamMiddleCell_scaledRationalRemainder_le`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4167)).

For $`C_s=-3`$, the correct label is $`c=1`$. This estimate does have a local consequence: since $`4^{s+1}R_s>2^{s+2}+4/3`$, it gives $`\rho<R_s`$. Thus the completed support $`D_s\cup\{s+1,s+2,\ldots\}`$ has value greater than $`1/2`$. It does not prove that every later greedy step survives. For $`s\ge13`$, under the additional all-right-tail hypothesis, the same completed support would have value less than $`1/2`$, giving the contradiction in [`finalMiddleCell_neg_three_not_last`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderFinalMiddleCellEscape.lean#L587). That tail hypothesis must not be dropped. For $`c=2,3`$, the displayed upper bound alone no longer gives $`\rho<R_s`$.

A parallel equivalence holds for the right branch: an overshoot witness $`\le2^s`$ produces a pulse leak above $`2^{s+2}`$ exactly when the overshoot lies within an explicit distance $`k`$ of $`2^s`$ with $`4k<\mathrm{abovePulse}`$ ([`seamRightPulseLeak_iff_distanceCell`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4202)). The remainder left by the integer greedy rule with the row-$`s`$ quotient weights and target $`2^{2s-1}`$ ([`seamPureHalfPrefixRemainder`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4232)) has an exact case-split formula ([`seamPureHalfPrefixRemainder_eq_ite`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4238)), and a bound on it is proved equivalent to the two-sided bound ([`seamPureHalfPrefixRemainder_le_iff_twoSided`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4356)).

*Observation 184* (The reset-band hypothesis has a verified base case). The upper-reset dyadic-band escape condition (discussed after Section <a href="#sec:o4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:o4">12.5</a>) is reduced by three lemmas to a quarter-scale overshoot exclusion: an equivalence ([`seamUpperReset_band_iff_successorRemainder_avoids`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4469)) rewrites the reset-charge band as a successor-remainder avoidance; an identity ([`upperResetCharge_dyadicDistance_add_abovePulse`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4490)) rescales it by a factor of $`4`$; and a third lemma ([`seamUpperReset_band_of_overshoot_band`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4514)) derives the band from a quarter-scale overshoot exclusion plus the pulse bound $`\mathrm{abovePulse}\le
2(d-2)`$. Row $`d=13`$, the first row of the late regime, is then proved unconditionally to escape *every* band simultaneously: its successor remainder is exactly $`392`$, by exact computation ([`seamUpperResetDyadicBandEscape_at_thirteen`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4547)). This is one verified row of a hypothesis required for every $`d\ge13`$; it shows only that the base case is not itself an obstruction.

<a id="finite-approximations-without-compatibility"></a>

##### Finite approximations without compatibility

For a finite support $`D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,M\}`$, the integer
``` math
K_D(M)=2^{M-1}-\sum_{j=2}^{M}2^{M-j}\#\{d\in D:d\mid j\}
```
is the half-carry at the terminal rank. It is $`\operatorname{ihc}(D,M-1)`$ in the notation used earlier. The condition below asks for $`M_j\to\infty`$ and finite sets $`D_j`$ with $`|K_{D_j}(M_j)|/2^{M_j}\to0`$. It does not require the sets to agree or bound the carries at earlier ranks. The estimate
``` math
\left|\sum_{d\in D_j}\frac1{2^d-1}-\frac12\right|
 \le\frac{|K_{D_j}(M_j)|+2\sqrt{M_j}+4}{2^{M_j}}
```
explains the hypothesis: it makes the finite values converge to $`1/2`$. Compactness then gives membership, but not the finite approximants needed to apply the theorem. A square-root terminal bound is sufficient and stronger as a bound on these particular witnesses; no claim of a strict logical separation between the corresponding existence statements follows.

Here is the finite family used in the cited construction. Put $`B(m)=2\lfloor\sqrt m\rfloor+4`$. A depth-$`M`$ family with a shared prefix through $`K\le M`$ consists of sets $`A_1,\ldots,A_{B(M)}\subseteq\{2,\ldots,M\}`$ such that
``` math
1\le K_{A_k}(m)\le B(m)\quad(1\le m\le M),
 \qquad K_{A_k}(M)=k,
```
all $`A_k`$ agree through $`K`$, and one integer $`E\ge B(M)`$ satisfies
``` math
\sum_{j=K+1}^{M}1_{A_k}(j)2^{M-j}+k=E
 \quad(1\le k\le B(M)).
```
The suffixes therefore have consecutive binary values $`E-k`$. The following statements explain how these particular families supply finite approximations; they do not construct them at arbitrary depths.

**Proposition 185**. *Every shared-prefix family just defined at depth $`N`$ contains a finite support $`A`$ with $`|K_A(N)|\le B(N)`$, and at a feedback row this survives *both* outputs of the corpus’s total feedback theorem; full-cylinder advance or a localized one-hole seam, which can delete at most one of carries $`3,4`$.*

Four concrete instances, at depths $`51`$–$`54`$, are verified by exact computation of the underlying stages ([`fullCylinderStage51_halfTerminalOnlyStripWitness`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/SuffixCylinderTerminalOnlyBridge.lean#L231), [`fullCylinderStage54_halfTerminalOnlyStripWitness`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/SuffixCylinderTerminalOnlyBridge.lean#L257)).

The hypothesis requires these finite families at arbitrarily large depths and is unproved. The terminal bound then implies half-membership. This is a sufficient condition; no converse or strict comparison with other sufficient conditions is established here.

<a id="removing-one-case-from-a-sufficient-tail-condition"></a>

##### Removing one case from a sufficient tail condition

Five Lean declarations reduce the cases that remain to be checked in the square-root lower bound on the producer carry at late middle rows (discussed in Part IV), using the proved exclusion of the $`-3`$ cell. No strict separation of the existence conditions is inferred from dropping that case.

<div class="defn">

**Definition 187**. The *middle tail condition* is the hypothesis that at every genuine middle transition ($`s\ge13`$, no successor carry, below the terminal-weight threshold) the terminal-augmented binary coefficient tail is strictly below the signed carry ([`SeamMiddleProducerTailEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderLastProducerContradiction.lean#L34)). The *reduced middle tail condition* is the same hypothesis restricted to cells $`\ne-3`$ ([`SeamMiddleProducerTailEscapeExceptNegThree`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderLastProducerContradiction.lean#L54)).

</div>

The middle tail condition trivially implies the reduced one ([`SeamMiddleProducerTailEscape.toExceptNegThree`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderLastProducerContradiction.lean#L76)); the substance is in the converse direction. The reduced condition, with cell $`-3`$ discharged by the already proved exclusion ([`middleProducer_neg_three_not_last`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderLastProducerContradiction.lean#L364)), already suffices for half-membership:
``` math
\text{reduced middle tail condition}\ \Longrightarrow\ \tfrac12\in\mathcal{A}
```
([`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_middleProducerTailEscapeExceptNegThree`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderLastProducerContradiction.lean#L436)). The unreduced condition and the square-root bound both imply it ([`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_middleProducerTailEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderLastProducerContradiction.lean#L451)). So the square-root bound implies the middle tail condition, which implies the reduced condition, which implies $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$: a chain of sufficient implications. The arrows do not prove that any implication is strict; all three antecedents remain unproved.

<a id="an-eventual-nonnegative-margin"></a>

##### An eventual nonnegative margin

The finite-horizon condition can be stated directly. Recall the integer margin $`F_k(J)`$ from Theorem <a href="#thm:frozen-margin" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:frozen-margin">56</a> and its equivalence with a negative excess ([`exists_greedyHalfFrozenMargin_nonneg_iff_excess_neg`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderFiniteShadow.lean#L1229)).

<div class="defn">

**Definition 188** (A nonnegative margin by the next depth). At every skipped step $`k+1`$, require
``` math
\exists J\in\{0,\ldots,k+1\},\qquad F_k(J)\ge0.
```

[`HalfGreedyGovernedFrozenMarginProducer`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderFiniteShadow.lean#L1267)

</div>

It implies $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$ ([`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_governedFrozenMarginProducer`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderFiniteShadow.lean#L1275), through [`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_skipped_dyadicCap`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean#L1444)). Indeed, the finite coefficient window is at most its infinite tail, so $`F_k(J)\ge0`$ implies $`r_k(1/2)\le2^{-(k+1)}`$ at that skip. This is below $`R_{k+1}`$. At $`k=0`$ the remainder is exactly $`1/2`$ and the same inequality holds; the strict version in Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-c19" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-c19">130</a> requires positive $`k`$.

The bound $`J\le k+1`$ is *not used* in this implication. Allowing any finite $`J`$ at each skip already suffices; requiring first passage by $`k+1`$ is a stronger finite-horizon demand, not a necessary ingredient of the membership proof. Neither all-skip existence condition is established here, and no equivalence between the bounded and unbounded horizons is asserted.

<a id="rewriting-the-signed-carry-recurrence"></a>

##### Rewriting the signed carry recurrence

Numeral-adjacent boundary words have more structure than the previously used coefficient bound. If the lower suffix numeral is one larger than the upper suffix numeral, there is a unique carry pivot $`d`$: rank $`d`$ enters the lower support, every rank $`e`$ with $`d<e\le N`$ flips from lower-unselected to upper-selected, and all ranks below $`d`$ agree ([`exists_carry_pivot_of_wordSuffixNumeral_succ`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/SuffixCylinderCarryPivot.lean#L141)). Hence for every positive coefficient row $`m\ge1`$ the boundary discrepancy is the exact divisor-incidence identity
``` math
c_{\rm low}(m)+\#\{e:d<e\le N,\ e\mid m\}
 =c_{\rm up}(m)+\mathbf 1_{d\mid m},
```
not merely an inequality ([`supportCoeff_add_deepDivisorCount_eq_of_carry_pivot`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/SuffixCylinderCarryPivot.lean#L163)).

The stage-level theorem consumes adjacent profiled prefixes directly ([`profiledGapStage_carry_pivot_of_hasAdjacentPrefixes`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/SuffixCylinderCarryPivot.lean#L228)). This is a local normal form for the two-sheet boundary. It does not produce adjacent stages at unbounded depths and therefore decides neither half-membership nor universal \#257.

##### Further restrictions on represented values

These results concern achievement-set geometry and do not settle the universal irrationality problem. For an arbitrary support restriction $`J\subseteq\mathbb{N}`$, let $`\mathcal A_J`$ be the set of Mersenne digit values supported on $`J`$ ([`supportedMersenneAchievementSet`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/MersenneSubseriesRigidity.lean#L76)). It is compact ([`isCompact_supportedMersenneAchievementSet`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/MersenneSubseriesRigidity.lean#L90)), nowhere dense for every $`J`$ ([`isNowhereDense_supportedMersenneAchievementSet`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/MersenneSubseriesRigidity.lean#L112)), and perfect, that is compact with no isolated points, whenever $`J`$ is infinite ([`perfect_supportedMersenneAchievementSet`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/MersenneSubseriesRigidity.lean#L167)), via a Cantor-space no-isolated-point argument on the coding space itself ([`preperfect_supportedMersenneDigitSet`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/MersenneSubseriesRigidity.lean#L120)).

**Proposition 189** (Exact Lebesgue-measure dichotomy). *Either $`J=F^c`$ for a finite $`F`$, and $`\mathrm{vol}(\mathcal A_J)=2^{-|F|}`$ exactly, or $`J^c`$ is infinite and the volume is exactly $`0`$.*

The finite case is an exact doubling induction over inserted coordinates ([`volume_supportedMersenneAchievementSet_insert`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/MersenneSubseriesRigidity.lean#L286)), using disjointness of the two coordinate-split faces ([`disjoint_supportedMersenneAchievementSet_translate`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/MersenneSubseriesRigidity.lean#L262)); this is where unique binary coding is used. The dichotomy is the case of retained coordinates of Hornich’s strict-tail measure formula \[nitecki2013, Theorem 4(1), p. 9\]: the retained Mersenne weights still exceed their tails, and the Mersenne tail estimate supplies the values $`2^{-|F|}`$ and $`0`$. None of this concerns irrationality of any subseries value.

##### Conditional counterexamples at rational targets

Finite supports whose scaled terminal carries tend to zero give an infinite $`A`$ with $`X_{A}(2)=1/2`$ ([`exists_rational_half_counterexample_of_terminalScaledVanishing`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/HalfCounterexampleFrontier.lean#L31)), and hence refute the universal statement ([`not_universal_of_terminalScaledVanishing`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/HalfCounterexampleFrontier.lean#L39); the universal statement itself has its own [`UniversalMersenneSubseriesIrrationality`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/HalfCounterexampleFrontier.lean#L26)). The required finite supports have only been checked to a large finite cutoff. This restates the open half-membership question; it is not a new result, since any representation of $`1/2`$ already refutes the universal statement.

A Lean theorem also proves an unconditional finite-support obstruction at the second rational target $`1/21`$:
``` math
F\subseteq\{n:n\ge2\}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
  \sum_{n\in F}\frac1{2^n-1}\ne\frac1{21}
```
for every finite $`F`$ ([`finiteErdosSum_ne_one_div_twenty_one`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/HalfCounterexampleFrontier.lean#L61)). The denominator-order identity forces $`\operatorname{lcm}(F)=6`$, after which the eight subsets of $`\{2,3,6\}`$ are exact arithmetic. This removes finite termination for that target; it does not establish achievement-set membership.

<a id="multiplicity-of-the-stated-twothree-representations"></a>

##### Multiplicity of the stated two–three representations

Consider the primitive representations $`2p+3q=n`$ with $`p,q>0`$ and $`\gcd(p,q)=1`$ ([`IsPrimitive23Solution`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/Primitive23Multiplicity.lean#L20)). Every $`n\ge11`$ has such a representation ([`exists_primitive23_solution_of_eleven_le`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/Primitive23Multiplicity.lean#L52)), while $`n=10`$ has none ([`no_primitive23_solution_ten`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/Primitive23Multiplicity.lean#L26)). The value $`n=11`$ already has two distinct representations ([`exists_two_primitive23_solutions_eleven`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/Primitive23Multiplicity.lean#L38)), and so does every $`n=10k`$ with $`k\ge2`$ ([`exists_two_primitive23_solutions_mul_ten`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/Primitive23Multiplicity.lean#L86)). These facts explain an approach and give no counterexample: nothing here proves that the associated integer-multiplicity expansion of $`1/21`$ can be made Boolean. The recurring multiplicities are precisely the unresolved collision data, not zero–one support digits.

<a id="integer-quotient-tests-for-one-twenty-first"></a>

##### Integer-quotient tests for one twenty-first

The later quotient-greedy analysis removes the diffuse alternatives. Let $`\mathcal F_{21}`$ denote the explicit branch consisting of a fatal greedy gap, finite skipped support (hence cofinite selection), eventual alignment between the quotient rows and the rational greedy prefix, and eventual visits to every doubling block. Then
``` math
\frac1{21}\in\ensuremath{\mathcal A}
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 \text{$\mathcal F_{21}$ does not hold}
```
([`one_div_twenty_one_mem_iff_not_fatalAlignedBranch`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TwentyOneQuotientGreedy.lean#L3507)).

On the fatal branch the canonical quotient remainder $`s_R`$ is eventually strictly above the closed capacity $`2^R`$ ([`twentyOneFatalAlignedBranch_eventually_strict_supercapacity`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TwentyOneQuotientGreedy.lean#L5625)), and thereafter the support appends $`R+1`$ while $`s_R`$ follows one explicit affine recurrence ([`twentyOneFatalAlignedBranch_eventually_affine_supercapacity`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TwentyOneQuotientGreedy.lean#L5658)). Conversely, closed rows $`s_R\le2^R`$ along any unbounded sequence decay after normalisation and put $`1/21`$ in the achievement set ([`twentyOneCofinalEvenQuotientGreedyDecay_of_closedRows`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TwentyOneQuotientGreedy.lean#L5554); [`one_div_twenty_one_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_cofinalGreedyDecay`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TwentyOneQuotientGreedy.lean#L5458)).

This is the exact current contribution: membership has been reduced to excluding one named permanent affine-supercapacity regime. No theorem excludes that regime, forces unbounded closed returns, or proves membership. Combined with the finite-support obstruction above, membership would provide an infinite-support rational counterexample to universal \#257; it remains open.

### Finite ranges and unbounded parameters

Two kinds of information matter to a reader deciding whether a result can be used as a premise: the kind of support behind it (a Lean proof, an exact finite computation, an ordinary argument, a cited theorem, or none, for an unproved hypothesis) and the range of its parameters. A result may concern one specified value; a finite tested range, or a witness bounded in terms of the input; every index in its stated range, with its hypotheses retained, which need not make it unconditional; or unboundedly many indices, in the form $`\forall N\,\exists n\ge N,\ P(n)`$. Compatibility between witnesses of the last kind is an additional requirement only when explicitly imposed.

The important distinction is between obtaining a witness in a finite range and proving the quantified assertion used by a membership test. For example, half-membership follows from unbounded successful exact rows or from infinitely many greedy skips. A different sufficient condition asks for a bound at every reset beyond its threshold. These statements have different quantifiers, even when the same transition formulas occur in their proofs. Each row must retain its predicate, quantified variable, and every premise. An unconditional eventual assertion $`\forall n\ge N_0,\,P(n)`$ does give cofinal witnesses to that same predicate, by taking $`n=\max(N,N_0)`$. A uniform conditional implication $`H(n)\Rightarrow C(n)`$ supplies no witness until $`H(n)`$ is established, and a checked finite band supplies no assertion beyond its endpoints. These are different logical shapes and are recorded separately below.

Table <a href="#tab:scale-ladder" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:scale-ladder">1</a> separates established finite or quantified results from unproved membership hypotheses and the proved implications that use them. Its lower part therefore contains proved theorems as well as open assumptions. The range alone determines neither the support nor the truth status; the stated predicate and premises do.

Likewise, a bound depending on the depth need not produce a witness at a larger depth. Conversely, a proved eventual assertion of the *same* witness predicate immediately gives cofinal witnesses. What decides the matter is the precise premise and conclusion, whatever tactic a finite proof uses.

### Approximations to the greedy orbit

<a id="four-reported-calculations"></a>

#### Four reported calculations

Fix the weights $`x_n:=1/(2^n-1)`$, $`n\ge2`$, and the target $`1/2`$. The single object under study throughout this programme is the greedy orbit for this target: a residual $`\rho`$ starts at $`1/2`$, and at rank $`k`$ the orbit *takes* iff $`\rho\ge x_k`$. A skip at rank $`k`$ is *safe* iff $`\rho\le T_{k+1}:=\sum_{j>k}x_j`$ and *fatal* iff $`\rho\in(T_{k+1},x_k)`$; the fatal interval is exactly the gap no later tail can repair. The four calculations below concern this target, but their finite parameters and certification records differ. Agreement with the real greedy prefix requires a convergence argument for the approximants used in each calculation; agreement over a tested range is not that argument.

- **Truncation rung $`J`$.** Replace the full weight $`x_n`$ by the $`J`$-term truncation $`w_n^{(J)}:=\sum_{q=1}^{J}2^{-qn}`$ and ask whether some Boolean support hits $`1/2`$ exactly under the truncated weights. Certified for $`3\le J\le22`$ (Table <a href="#tab:scale-ladder" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:scale-ladder">1</a>, finite ranges; Theorem <a href="#thm:tr-witness-exclusion" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:tr-witness-exclusion">196</a>–<a href="#thm:tr-finite-decision" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:tr-finite-decision">199</a> below).

- **Seam row $`s`$.** The base-4 seam recursion tracking the deviation $`\Delta_s:=\mathrm{rem}(s)-2^s`$ of the integer greedy orbit from its dyadic target. Certified rows $`6`$ through $`2500`$ for the reset-crossing classification, and the underlying orbit separately certified to row $`200{,}000`$, with exactly one violation of the target inequality at reset rows $`6\le r\le200{,}000`$, at $`r=7`$ (saved runs to [row $`2500`$](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/receipts/seam-reset-crossing-2500.json) and to [row $`200{,}000`$](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/receipts/seam-orbit-200000.json)).

- **Integer margin $`m_c`$.** An exploratory, unverified scan of the integer-greedy margin out to $`5\times10^5`$, tracking how far the certified region sits from the danger threshold.

- **Sharp tail margin.** The rank-by-rank take/skip margin against the exact tail, checked for ranks $`2`$ through $`3000`$: $`1497`$ takes against $`1502`$ skips, zero fatal skips anywhere, minimum safe-skip margin $`+2.9922`$ bits at rank $`5`$, and the smallest reported take-margin $`+0.0340`$ bits at rank $`7`$, where the remainder $`1/126`$ exceeds the weight $`1/127`$. Here the margins are the base-two logarithms of the corresponding positive slack multiplied by $`4^k`$ ([saved run](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/receipts/tail-margins-3000.json); [working note](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/notes/reset-crossing-unification-2026-07-24.md), section 8).

**Proposition 191** (Stability of each fixed greedy prefix). *Let $`t_j\to1/2`$ and, for each fixed $`n\ge2`$, let $`v_n^{(j)}\to x_n=(2^n-1)^{-1}`$, with $`v_n^{(j)}>0`$. Apply the greedy rule with target $`t_j`$ and weights $`v_n^{(j)}`$ in increasing order of $`n`$, through depths $`m_j\to\infty`$. For every fixed depth $`K`$, the decisions at ranks $`2,\ldots,K`$ eventually agree with those of the real half-greedy rule. This assertion concerns finite prefixes, not survival at all ranks.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* At rank $`2`$, the target and the weight converge to their real counterparts. Their comparison is strict by Lemma <a href="#lem:no-ties" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:no-ties">192</a>, so its sign is eventually unchanged. Inductively, once all earlier decisions agree, the approximate remainder is the target minus a fixed finite sum of convergent weights. It therefore converges to the real remainder. The next comparison is again strict, so the next decision eventually agrees. A finite induction through $`K`$ proves the claim. ◻

**Lemma 192** (No-ties lemma). *At every rank $`k`$ of the full greedy orbit for target $`1/2`$, both defining comparisons are strict: $`\rho\ne x_k`$ and $`\rho\ne T_{k+1}`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* The two strict comparisons have different reasons: parity excludes equality with a weight, and irrationality excludes equality with the complete tail.

*Take boundary excluded (parity).* Write a finite Mersenne sum as $`p/q=\sum_{d\in F}x_d`$ in lowest terms. Its denominator $`q`$ is odd, because every $`2^d-1`$ is odd (equivalently, [`halfGreedyPrefixDenominator_odd`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/DyadicPrefixCompression.lean#L1521), itself traced to [`finiteErdosSum_den_odd`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/DyadicPrefixCompression.lean#L1513)). Hence the residual after any finite prefix is $`\rho=\tfrac12-\tfrac pq=\tfrac{q-2p}{2q}`$: its reduced denominator is *even*. Every weight $`x_k=1/(2^k-1)`$ has *odd* denominator. An even-denominator rational can never equal an odd-denominator rational, so $`\rho=x_k`$ is impossible at any rank ; the take comparison is never a tie.

*Skip-safety boundary excluded (irrationality).* The tail past rank $`k`$ is $`T_{k+1}=E-1-\sum_{2\le j\le k}x_j`$, where $`E=\sum_{n\ge1}1/(2^n-1)`$ is the Erdős–Borwein constant: a rational shift of $`E`$. Erdős’s own 1948 theorem gives $`E`$ irrational ([`irrational_erdosBorwein_series`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean#L8335), instantiated at $`b=2`$), so $`T_{k+1}`$ is irrational for every $`k`$. The residual $`\rho`$ arising from any finite Boolean prefix is rational. An irrational number never equals a rational one, so $`\rho=T_{k+1}`$ is impossible at any rank; the skip-safety comparison is never a tie either.

Both boundaries of the fatal interval $`(T_{k+1},x_k)`$ are therefore approached only strictly, at every rank, unconditionally. ◻

</div>

<div class="rem">

*Remark 193*. The hypotheses of Proposition <a href="#prop:one-orbit" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:one-orbit">191</a> can be checked for two concrete approximations. The truncated geometric weights $`\sum_{q=1}^{J}2^{-qn}`$ increase to $`x_n`$. For the integer quotient rows, division by $`4^s`$ gives weights $`4^{-s}\lfloor4^s/(2^n-1)\rfloor\to x_n`$ and target $`4^{-s}(2^{2s-1}-2^s)=1/2-2^{-s}\to1/2`$. Hence both greedy rules agree with each fixed real prefix once their parameters are large enough. Convergent upper and lower bounds for $`R_k`$ likewise determine the strict tail comparison at a fixed rank. No conclusion about the exploratory margin scan follows without specifying its approximants and proving their convergence. Fixed-prefix agreement is not uniform agreement through a growing depth. For the quotient rows, however, summability bounds the unmatched tail by $`R_K`$ and does give convergence of the coded values, as proved in Theorem <a href="#thm:seam-limit" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:seam-limit">45</a>. It identifies their limit as $`X_G(2)`$; it does not establish that this value is $`1/2`$.

#### Successive tail truncations

Finite truncations of the geometric expansion give rational weights and permit a finite decision procedure for each fixed truncation order $`J`$. The bounds below explain why only finitely many ranks need to be tested. Fix $`J\ge2`$ and set
``` math
\begin{aligned}
w_n^{(J)}&:=\sum_{q=1}^{J}2^{-qn}, &
T_{n+1}^{(J)}&:=\sum_{q=1}^{J}\frac{2^{-qn}}{2^q-1},\\
\mathrm{HalfRung}(J)&:\Longleftrightarrow
\exists A\subseteq\{2,3,\ldots\},&
\sum_{n\in A}w_n^{(J)}&=\tfrac12.
\end{aligned}
```
The arguments below are ordinary mathematics. The accompanying exact integer computation rechecks the finite instances $`3\le J\le22`$; neither the arguments nor that computation are presented as a Lean verification.

**Lemma 194** (Forced greedy). *For every $`J\ge2`$: $`w_n^{(J)}>T_{n+1}^{(J)}`$ for all $`n`$ (the $`q=1`$ terms agree exactly, and every $`q\ge2`$ tail term is strictly smaller than the corresponding weight term). Consequently the greedy support is the unique candidate support, and $`\mathrm{HalfRung}(J)`$ holds iff the greedy orbit for $`1/2`$ under weights $`w_n^{(J)}`$ never lands in a fatal interval $`(T_{n+1}^{(J)},w_n^{(J)})`$.

**Theorem 196** (Witness exclusion). *Define the misalignment mass
``` math
\mu_J(M):=\sum_{q=2}^{J}\frac{2^{M\bmod q}}{2^q-1}.
```
Let $`J\ge3`$, $`n\ge4`$, and suppose some $`M\in[n,2n-2]`$ has $`\mu_J(M)\le\tfrac{11}{15}`$. Then no Boolean prefix $`D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,n-1\}`$ satisfies
``` math
T_{n+1}^{(J)}<\tfrac12-\sum_{d\in D}w_d^{(J)}<w_n^{(J)};
```
This excludes the specified gap for every Boolean prefix, not only the greedy prefix.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Suppose such a prefix exists and write $`\rho=1/2-\sum_{d\in D}w_d^{(J)}`$. Since $`T_{n+1}^{(J)}\ge2^{-n}`$ and $`n\le M\le2n-2`$,
``` math
0<2^M\rho-2^{M-n}
   <\sum_{q=2}^{J}2^{M-qn}
   \le\frac{2^{M-2n}}{1-2^{-n}}\le\frac4{15}.
```
Here $`n\ge4`$ gives the last inequality. Split each scaled summand $`2^{M-qd}`$ according to whether $`qd\le M`$. The terms with $`qd\le M`$ are integers. The other terms have total
``` math
F=\sum_{d\in D}\sum_{\substack{1\le q\le J\\qd>M}}2^{M-qd}
 \le\sum_{q=2}^{J}\sum_{d>\lfloor M/q\rfloor}2^{M-qd}
 =\mu_J(M)\le\frac{11}{15}.
```
There is no $`q=1`$ contribution to $`F`$, since $`d<n\le M`$. Thus $`2^M\rho+F-2^{M-n}`$ is an integer strictly between zero and one, a contradiction. The same calculation also applies when $`J=2`$. ◻

**Corollary 197** (Half-LCM horizon). *Let $`J\ge2`$ and $`L_J:=\mathrm{lcm}(2,3,\ldots,J)`$. For every $`n\ge\max\{4,L_J/2+1\}`$ there is an $`M\in[n,2n-2]`$ with $`\mu_J(M)<11/15`$. Thus witness exclusion leaves only the finite window $`[4,L_J/2]`$ to check.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Let $`M`$ be the least multiple of $`L_J`$ with $`M\ge n`$. If $`M=L_J`$, then $`M\le2n-2`$ is the assumed inequality. If $`M=kL_J`$ with $`k\ge2`$, then $`n\ge(k-1)L_J+1`$ gives $`2n-2\ge2(k-1)L_J\ge M`$. At this witness,
``` math
\mu_J(M)=\sum_{q=2}^{J}\frac1{2^q-1}
 <\sum_{q=2}^{\infty}\frac{4}{3\cdot2^q}
 =\frac23<\frac{11}{15}.

The bound uses $`2^q-1\ge3\cdot2^{q-2}`$, with strict inequality for $`q>2`$, so no numerical approximation to the full series is needed.

Then $`\mathrm{HalfRung}(J)`$ holds iff the greedy orbit for $`1/2`$ under weights $`w_n^{(J)}`$ survives every rank from $`2`$ through $`B(J)`$. This is a finite exact decision procedure.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Survival at all ranks plainly implies survival through $`B(J)`$. Conversely, every later rank at most $`L_J/2`$ has a witness by the definition of $`B(J)`$, and every larger rank has one by Corollary <a href="#cor:tr-half-lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="cor:tr-half-lcm">197</a>. Witness exclusion rules out a fatal gap at all these ranks. The strict-tail criterion then gives membership. For $`J=2`$, the same proof works because $`\mu_2(M)\le2/3`$ for every $`M`$; the window is empty and $`B(2)=3`$. ◻

<div class="rem">

*Remark 200* (Verified truncations and the unbounded-index question). The finite decision procedure verifies $`\mathrm{HalfRung}(J)`$ for every $`3\le J\le22`$. The checking program uses exact integers: it verifies witness intervals covering the ranks beyond $`B(J)`$, proves for $`J\le16`$ that the listed bad ranks have no witness, and tests the greedy remainders through $`B(J)`$. In particular, it reproduces $`B(19)=1008`$ and $`B(20)=B(21)=B(22)=1530`$. The [checking program](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/check_truncation_rung_ladder.py) and its saved outputs for [$`3\le J\le16`$](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/receipts/truncation-ladder-3-16.json) and [$`17\le J\le22`$](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/receipts/truncation-ladder-17-22.json) are published. For $`J\ge17`$ a floating-point filter proposes witnesses and each accepted witness is rechecked with integers, so a missed witness could only lengthen the exact greedy check. These are finite computer-assisted proofs using the ordinary lemmas above, not Lean proofs and not a test of the full weights through all ranks.

If $`A`$ represents $`1/2`$ with the $`J`$-truncated weights, then
``` math
0\le X_A(2)-\tfrac12
 \le\sum_{q>J}\frac{2^{-2q}}{1-2^{-q}}
 \le2\sum_{q>J}4^{-q}=\frac23\,4^{-J}.
```
Consequently, such representations for an unbounded sequence of $`J`$ would put $`1/2`$ in the closed set $`\mathcal A`$. Its representing support would be infinite, since finite Mersenne sums have odd denominator (Lemma <a href="#lem:no-ties" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:no-ties">192</a>); Lemma <a href="#lem:tr-parity" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:tr-parity">195</a> separately excludes finite support for each truncation. The unbounded-index assertion is still unproved. Twenty verified values of $`J`$ do not establish it.

### Which hypotheses remain unproved

This section compares the stated results with the remaining hypotheses. Each result is tested against three exact open obligations: what it yields, where it falls short of the obligation (a stronger hypothesis, a different parameter range, a different quantifier order, a different expression of the same condition, or several of these), and the exact auxiliary statement that would close the gap. Nothing here decides \#249 or \#257. A conditional reduction is a result with a hypothesis, not a proof of that hypothesis, and a finite verified list does not supply witnesses at unbounded depths.

<a id="the-three-257-obligations-stated-exactly"></a>

#### The three \#257 obligations, stated exactly

<div class="defn">

**Definition 201** (257-reset). For every upper or middle reset row $`r\ge10`$, require $`\Delta_{r+1}^2>2^{r+5}`$, where $`\Delta_{r+1}=\mathrm{rem}(r+1)-2^{r+1}`$. The finite range $`10\le r<31`$ must be covered as well as the tail. Section <a href="#sec:o4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:o4">12.5</a> gives the exact conditional implication from this hypothesis. A proposed bound on right-run lengths is a different statement until the pulse corrections and endpoint conventions are matched. Finite observations establish neither failure of every constant run bound nor logarithmic asymptotic growth.

</div>

<div class="defn">

**Definition 202** (257-cofinal-rows). For every $`N`$ there is $`n\ge N`$ with an exact row at depth $`n`$ (Definition <a href="#record:257bm-d1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-d1">106</a>); that is, there are finite sets at unboundedly many depths whose quotient sums land exactly on the half-value target. This condition implies $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$ unconditionally ([`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_cofinalExactLocalRows`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusCofinalExactRows.lean#L71)). No coherence between the witnessing rows is demanded and none should be assumed: the rows may be mutually incompatible; only their depths need tend to infinity. Requiring compatibility would add a condition on the witnesses. Whether that condition can be obtained from this existence statement needs a separate extraction argument; it is not a strict logical comparison merely because the witnesses are described differently.

</div>

<div class="defn">

**Definition 203** (257-universal). The original question is the base-$`2`$ statement: $`\sum_{n\in A}(2^n-1)^{-1}`$ is irrational for every infinite $`A\subseteq\mathbb N_{\ge1}`$. Asking the same for every integer base $`b\ge2`$ is a stronger all-base extension, not the definition of Problem #257 itself.

#### Reset estimates and their missing hypotheses

<div class="obs">

*Observation 204* (Remainders along a right-branch run). [`upperOrMiddle_within_of_two_pow_deficit`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderResetDeficitEscape.lean#L261). For integers $`s\ge5`$ and $`k\ge0`$, the cited theorem assumes $`\mathrm{rem}(s)\le2^s`$ and $`2^k(2^s-\mathrm{rem}(s))\ge2^s`$ and gives an upper or middle transition at some $`t\in[s,s+k]`$. Its literal contrapositive concerns *all* $`k+1`$ transition indices in that closed interval.

For a run of exactly $`k\ge1`$ right transitions, at indices $`s,\ldots,s+k-1`$, a direct recurrence gives the sharper conventionally indexed statement. Put $`D_j=2^{s+j}-\mathrm{rem}(s+j)`$ and $`p_j=p^-_{s+j}\ge0`$. The right-branch identity yields
``` math
D_{j+1}=4D_j+p_j+4,\qquad
 4^kD_0<D_k\le2^{s+k}.
```
The strict inequality uses $`k\ge1`$, and the last bound uses $`\mathrm{rem}(s+k)\ge0`$. Hence $`D_0<2^{s-k}`$. In particular, $`D_0\ge1`$ excludes $`k\ge s`$ consecutive right transitions. A stronger lower bound on $`D_0`$ shortens that run, but must be established at the starting row of the run. Applying this argument after a reset requires the post-reset index and the *deficit-side* condition; it does not prove the absolute reset bound on both signs.

<div id="obs:affine-excess-recurrence" class="obs">

*Observation 205* (The affine excess recurrence). [`affineRightExcess_exactIterate`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L3320), [`affineRightExcess_charge_lt_scaledInitial`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L3350), [`eventualRightTail_excess_exactIterate`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L3361) (recurrence [`rightBranch_excess_succ_eq`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L2497)). For $`k`$ right transitions from row $`S\ge5`$, let $`X_j=\mathrm{rem}(S+j)-2^{S+j}`$ and $`p_j=p^-_{S+j}`$. The cited identity is
``` math
X_0=\frac{X_k}{4^k}+\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\frac{p_j+4}{4^{j+1}}.
```
The source also gives $`0\le p_j\le2(S+j-2)`$. Thus the following consequences are ordinary deductions from the identity:
``` math
\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\frac{p_j+4}{4^{j+1}}
 \le\sum_{j\ge0}\frac{2(S+j)}{4^{j+1}}
 =\frac{2S}{3}+\frac29.
```
If the terminal row satisfies $`\mathrm{rem}(S+k)<2^{S+k+1}`$, then
``` math
X_0<2^{S-k}+\frac{2S}{3}+\frac29.
```
Only this terminal bound is needed; no bound at every intermediate row is required. If instead the largest omitted rank $`d`$ at the terminal row satisfies $`2(S+k)<3d`$, the next entry gives the different bound
``` math
X_0<2^{S-k}+\frac{2\,4^{S+k-d}+4}{3\,4^k}
                +\frac{2S}{3}+\frac29.
```
The extra term must be retained. Lateness of an omitted rank is not known to be equivalent to $`\mathrm{rem}(s)<2^{s+1}`$; the cited estimate alone does not imply that sharper ceiling. Neither upper bound supplies the missing lower bound on an actual reset deviation.

<div class="obs">

*Observation 206* (A bound at later rows). [`three_mul_remainder_lt_exactLateGap`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderResetDeficitEscape.lean#L117). For $`s\ge5`$, if $`d`$ is the largest omitted rank and $`2s<3d`$, the cited theorem gives
``` math
\mathrm{rem}(s)<2^{s+1}+\frac{2\,4^{s-d}+4}{3}.
```
Since $`s-d<s/3`$, its additive error is at most $`(2\cdot2^{2s/3}+4)/3`$, hence $`O(2^{2s/3})`$. The undivided error $`2\,4^{s-d}+4`$ need not be less than $`2^{2s/3}`$: already $`s=7,d=5`$ gives $`36>2^{14/3}`$. These numbers test the numerical estimate, not an asserted pair on the greedy orbit. The theorem supplies an upper bound only under the largest-omitted-rank and lateness assumptions. When it is used in the preceding recurrence, its additive error remains part of the result.

<div class="obs">

*Observation 207* (Exclusion of equality at a branch boundary). [`seamGreedyFloorZ_ne_takeThreshold`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L1665), with [`halfGreedy_skipped_endpoint_trichotomy`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderSkippedEndpointClassifier.lean#L246). The first cited theorem excludes equality between the corrected real-valued quotient expression and the terminal *take threshold*: such equality would give a finite Mersenne sum equal to $`1/2`$, contrary to denominator parity. The second classifies the signed integer position of a real greedy prefix at a skipped rank; its statement explicitly permits the zero-position case.

Neither statement identifies its boundary with $`\mathrm{rem}(r)=2^r`$. They therefore do not, by themselves, prove $`|\mathrm{rem}(r)-2^r|\ge1`$. Integrality gives that inequality only after nonvanishing of this particular deviation has been proved. An estimate of the form $`2^{r/2+o(r)}`$ would not settle the required constant either: $`2^{r/2}/r`$ has that form but is smaller than $`2^{(r+5)/2}`$. The reset hypothesis requires its stated constant, strict inequality and post-reset index, not merely an exponent approaching $`1/2`$.

*Observation 208* (A sharper test for a fatal greedy gap). [`skipSafe_of_two_mul_le_three_mul`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfGreedyFatalGap.lean#L107), [`three_mul_lt_two_mul_of_fatal`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfGreedyFatalGap.lean#L146), [`two_le_of_fatal`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfGreedyFatalGap.lean#L161), [`three_le_of_fatal_of_odd`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfGreedyFatalGap.lean#L173). Let $`k\ge1`$ be a skipped rank and write its positive rational remainder in lowest terms as $`\rho=u/(2L)<w_k`$, with $`u,L`$ odd and positive. Set $`a=2L-(2^k-1)u>0`$. The cited sufficient condition $`2u\le3a`$ guarantees $`\rho<R_k`$ and improves the simpler condition $`u\le a`$. Its contrapositive gives $`3a<2u`$ at a fatal skip, and hence $`u\ge3`$ when $`u`$ is odd.

This is not the exact threshold. With $`\theta_k=R_k^{-1}-(2^k-1)`$, direct rearrangement gives
``` math
\rho<R_k\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad u\theta_k<a.
```
The tail estimate gives $`\theta_k<2/3`$ and $`\theta_k\to2/3`$; $`2u\le3a`$ is therefore sufficient, not necessary. For example, at $`k=2`$ the local rational state $`\rho=77/282`$ has $`u=77`$, $`L=141`$, $`a=51`$, so $`2u>3a`$, yet $`\sum_{j=3}^{12}(2^j-1)^{-1}>77/282`$ proves $`\rho<R_2`$. This is a local state, not an asserted point of the half-greedy orbit. Improving a bounded tail ratio alone does not provide a lower bound growing exponentially in $`k`$ on an arithmetic numerator; such a bound would require additional information about the actual prefix.

*Observation 209* (Exclusion of a linear-width band at rows 13–30).

4\cdot\mathrm{overshoot}_d + \mathrm{abovePulse}_d`$ avoids the linear-width band $`(2^{d-j+1}-2(d+j),\ 2^{d-j+1}]`$ for every $`j \le d`$; the finite segment of [`SeamUpperResetDyadicBandEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4566), whose full form would give half-membership by [`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_upperResetDyadicBandEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4790), and so refute the universal statement. **Parameter range.** Proved at 18 explicit rows by exact computation checked in the Lean kernel; the obligation needs all $`d \ge 13`$. The excluded band has width $`O(d)`$, whereas the reset condition uses a width of order $`2^{(r+5)/2}`$. This is a comparison of numerical scales, not a proof that one hypothesis on the orbit implies the other. **Missing step.** A structural lower bound on the distance from $`E_d`$ to the nearest dyadic power at or above it, of width $`2(d+j_0)`$ at the single critical index $`j_0`$; already collapsed from $`\forall j`$ to one inequality by [`HalfUpperResetCriticalBand.dyadicBandEscape_iff_exists_critical`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfUpperResetCriticalBand.lean#L108). Only $`O(d)`$ separation is required here; separation at the square root of the dyadic scale is not needed.

\mathrm{rem}(s+1)`$, using no lower bound on the source remainder; with the row-scale source bound this upgrades to $`2^{s+1}+(s+1) \le \mathrm{rem}(s+1)`$. A minimal-counterexample argument in the same Lean source then shows that any row whose remainder is smaller than its index must have an upper-reset (U) ancestor, since M-ancestors and R-runs are both excluded. **Scope of the hypothesis.** Two of the three ancestor channels (M, R) are closed unconditionally at all scales; only the U channel remains, and it needs only the $`O(d)`$-wide band escape of the preceding observation. The 257-reset statement demands escape at the square root of the dyadic scale, whereas linear-width escape at U-resets alone suffices for this argument. **Missing step.** The single remaining channel: for every $`d \ge 13`$ with successor carries, the reset charge avoids the width-$`2(d+j_0)`$ band at its critical dyadic index. Then the remainder is at least the row index at every late middle row, which is the hypothesis of the next observation, and hence $`1/2 \in \ensuremath{\mathcal A}`$; each of these implications is already proved in Lean.

The hypothesis is much weaker than an exponential bound, but stronger than the square-root-scale carry bound. **Scope of the hypothesis.** This hypothesis asks for a *linear-in-row* lower bound on the remainder itself; the obligation supplies an *exponential* lower bound on the deviation from $`2^s`$ at reset rows. For unrestricted numerical values, a large absolute deviation from $`2^s`$ permits $`\mathrm{rem}(s)=0`$, which violates the linear lower bound. That observation is not a counterexample within the actual recurrence, so incomparability of the two orbit hypotheses is not established. **Missing step.** $`\forall s \ge 13`$ at a middle transition, $`s \le \mathrm{rem}(s)`$. The upper-reset band condition described above is one sufficient input to this linear bound; no converse is asserted.

In the middle case put
``` math
X_{D+1}:=\mathrm{rem}(D+1)-2^{D+1}
          =4\,\mathrm{rem}(D)-p_D^-=C_D+4.
```
The cited bounds give $`2\le X_{D+1}<2\sqrt{2D+2}+8`$. This permits nonnegative $`C_D`$ as well as the negative exceptional values $`-2,-1`$; the latter do not exhaust the remaining interval. **Scope of the hypothesis.** the residual bad set is an explicit $`O(\sqrt D)`$-wide integer window at each candidate last non-right transition row, not an interval at dyadic scale. The reset hypothesis would exclude this window. Its width is much smaller than $`2^{(r+5)/2}`$, but width alone does not measure the difficulty of proving that the actual sequence avoids it. **Missing step.** Exclude every integer
``` math
2\le X_{D+1}\le\bigl\lceil2\sqrt{2D+2}\bigr\rceil+7
```
at a hypothetical last middle transition $`D\ge13`$. The ceiling is necessary when converting the strict real upper bound to an integer interval. Excluding only $`C_D=-2,-1`$ does not suffice.

*Observation 217* (Structure of resets after long runs). **Conclusion.** At a dangerous reset $`r`$ ($`|\mathrm{rem}(r{+}1)-2^{r+1}| \le 2^{(r+5)/2}`$) whose preceding reset $`r_0`$ has pure R-run length $`L' = r-r_0-1 > (r+5)/4`$, the deviation $`w_{r_0+1}`$ is pinned to at most two adjacent integers determined by the divisor-pulse stream alone; a chain of $`n`$ dangerous resets forces $`n{-}1`$ nested exact integer-coincidence towers. **Scope of the hypothesis.** applies only to dangerous resets preceded by a long pure R-run ($`L' > (r+5)/4`$); an isolated dangerous reset after a short run is untouched. Pinning to two integers is not yet a contradiction: no theorem excludes those two values. This is an ordinary argument; it is not formalised. **Missing step.** (i) a congruence or pulse-stream obstruction showing the two pinned integer values are unattainable, and (ii) removal of the long-preceding-run hypothesis, or a proof that dangerous resets must enter chains to which the exclusion applies. Excluding the two pinned values addresses only resets satisfying the long-run hypothesis; covering all remaining resets is a separate requirement. Neither step alone proves a global exclusion.

*Observation 218* (The sign condition and growth of the margin). **Conclusion.** At all 1209 observed resets, M $`\Rightarrow`$ deviation $`>0`$ and U $`\Rightarrow`$ deviation $`<0`$, with zero exceptions; the margin over the $`2^{(r+5)/2}`$ threshold grows from 1.11 bits at $`r=14`$ to $`\sim`$<!-- -->1246 bits at $`r=2500`$. The record isolates this as a separate, possibly more tractable target than the full square-root escape. **Different restrictions.** The upper sign follows from the positive reset charge: $`w_{r+1}=-(4o_r+p_r^+)<0`$. The middle sign is equivalent to $`4\mathrm{rem}(r)>p_r`$ and needs further information about the orbit. Neither sign implies a square-root lower bound on the absolute deviation. **Missing step.** Prove that middle inequality and then a quantitative margin on each branch. The exact branch calculation is given in Section <a href="#sec:invent-R1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:invent-R1">11.1</a>; it is not a substitute for the magnitude estimate.

*Observation 219* (Comparison of finite truncation lengths). The exact finite procedure in Theorem <a href="#thm:tr-finite-decision" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:tr-finite-decision">199</a> verifies the twenty truncations $`3\le J\le22`$. The proof combines finite integer certificates with a witness bound valid beyond the finite search horizon; it does not infer an infinite statement from a long finite run. The certificates accompany that computation. Representations for an unbounded sequence of $`J`$ would yield a representation of $`1/2`$ for the full weights by the compactness estimate following that theorem. That unbounded-index premise remains unproved. The size of the least-common-multiple horizon affects this finite algorithm, but is not an impossibility theorem for other arguments.

A protected row is either doubled while its real value stays below $`1/2`$, or extended using its first crossing rank $`e`$. In the latter case protection gives $`2e-2`$ strictly larger than the old endpoint. **Scope of the hypothesis.** The recycle branch uses the critical quotient supply hypothesis whenever recycling is required.

The proof derives $`A < 2^{c-2}+|D|`$ then discards $`|D| \le c-2 \le 2^{c-2}`$; the loss is purely additive. The true unproved statement is only that $`A`$ avoids the linear-width band $`[2^{c-2},\,2^{c-2}+c-3]`$, width $`c{-}2`$ inside a range of size $`2^{c-2}`$. **Missing step.** A linear-width dyadic-band anti-concentration: at cofinally many crossing ranks $`c`$, $`\ensuremath{S}\,D\,1\,(2c{-}2) \notin [2^{c-2},\,2^{c-2}+c-3]`$.

This is the only unconditional endpoint-doubling step in this record. **Scope of the hypothesis.** Below-halfness is not preserved and demonstrably fails at the first step. For the seed $`D=\{2,3,6\}`$ at $`M=11`$ the core alone contributes $`2/3+4/7+32/63 \approx 1.746 > 1`$, so the doubled row is strictly *above* half. Iterating the cheap arm is therefore impossible from the only recorded seed; the chain is forced into the capacity-gated recycle arm at step one. **Missing step.** Cofinally many below-half exact rows; $`\forall N\ \exists n \ge N\ \exists D`$ exact at $`n`$ with $`\mathrm{localFractionMass}\,D\,n < 1`$.

The proof is fully uniform in $`(c,t)`$, every constant explicit, no table. **Missing step.** For cofinally many skipped ranks $`c`$ of the rational half-greedy orbit, the next skipped rank is at most $`c+(c-3-\lceil\log_2(c-2)\rceil)`$.

Assuming this property, a Lean theorem proves $`1/2\in\ensuremath{\mathcal A}`$. **Order of quantifiers.** The horizon is exactly three doubling steps short. The exact-row hypothesis needs margin$`(k,k{-}2)\ge0`$; this gives margin$`(k,k{+}1)\ge0`$. By the succ-recurrence, margin$`(k,k{+}1)=8\cdot`$margin$`(k,k{-}2)+4\,\mathrm{sc}(2k)+2\,\mathrm{sc}(2k{+}1)
+\mathrm{sc}(2k{+}2)`$, where $`\mathrm{sc}`$ is the divisor count, bounded by $`\tau\le 2\sqrt{2k+2}`$. Since nonnegativity is monotone *up* in $`J`$, the cited statement is the weaker one and cannot supply the obligation as it stands. **Missing step.** A horizon-tightening; at every skipped rank, margin$`(k,k{+}1) \ge
4\,\mathrm{sc}(2k)+2\,\mathrm{sc}(2k{+}1)+\mathrm{sc}(2k{+}2)`$: the full-shell margin must exceed an explicit $`O(\sqrt k)`$ divisor-count quantity, on the same square-root scale as the carry bounds above.

\ensuremath{\mathcal A}`$. **Scope of the hypothesis.** It is equivalent to the problem itself. The positivity conjunct $`0 < \ensuremath{r}(1/2)(c{-}1)`$ holds unconditionally by the odd-denominator parity fact, so the hypothesis says exactly that the greedy rule for $`1/2`$ skips infinitely many ranks, which Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-c20" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-c20">131</a> proves equivalent to $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$. Thus proving this hypothesis would settle the half-target question itself. **What remains.** One must prove that this fixed greedy sequence has infinitely many skips. Equivalence neither supplies that proof nor rules out finding a useful invariant for the sequence. The condition in Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-c7" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-c7">118</a> instead permits finite supports that are not greedy prefixes.

**Different restrictions.** The terminal condition permits *any* support inside the depth-$`M`$ window but demands the carry inside a $`\sim 2\sqrt M`$ strip; the obligation form ($`\star`$) tolerates a carry up to $`2^{M/2-1}`$, exponentially looser, but demands the support be confined to ranks $`<
M/2+1`$, since the exact fill encodes the residue in the pure upper window where the Mersenne quotient is exactly $`2^{M-d}`$. The essential difference is where the support may sit.

**Missing step.** Confinement of the strip witnesses to the lower half: $`\forall N\
\exists c\ge N`$ with a strip-scale witness whose support lies in $`[2,c)`$ at depth $`2c{-}3`$. Then $`2\sqrt{2c}+4<2^{c-2}`$ for $`c\ge8`$ gives the required numerical capacity bound.

No such factorisation is asserted for the weighted support theorem in Section <a href="#sec:257-problem" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:257-problem">1</a>. **Scope of the hypothesis.** The criterion is already universally quantified over $`A`$; the universal quantifier is *not* the gap. The certificate hypothesis must hold at every precision, and it is supplied only for named classes; certificate existence for an arbitrary infinite $`A`$ remains open. **Limit of this sufficient condition.** Supplying these certificates for every infinite support would imply the universal statement, but Proposition <a href="#prop:squarefree" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:squarefree">274</a> rules out that supply for the two specified certificate schemes. The carry variant replaces digit-wise divisibility by aggregate divisibility $`b^K\mid\sum_r c_A(N+r)b^{K-r}`$; the squarefree obstruction applies to that variant too. Universal certificate supply is therefore not being posed as an unresolved equivalent formulation of Problem 257.

For every rational $`x\ge0`$,
``` math
x\in\mathcal A\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 \text{the greedy algorithm for $x$ skips infinitely many ranks}.
```
The reverse implication holds for every real $`x\ge0`$: a fatal remainder $`r_n(x)>R_n`$ forces every subsequent weight to be taken, because $`R_n=w_{n+1}+R_{n+1}`$. Hence infinitely many skips exclude a fatal remainder, and Theorem <a href="#thm:greedy-survival" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:greedy-survival">10</a> gives membership. For the forward implication, membership identifies the greedy sum with $`x`$. Finitely many skips would make that sum $`E`$ minus a finite rational sum, which is irrational by Erdős’s theorem \[erdos1948\]. This contradicts rationality of $`x`$ and proves the stated extension as an ordinary argument.

Infinitely many skips do not mean infinitely many selected ranks: $`x=1/3`$ has the single-element support $`\{2\}`$ and skips every other rank. Thus the equivalence does not decide which rational targets are represented, or provide an infinite support with rational value. The Lean declarations above concern the half target; the extension to every rational target is an ordinary argument and is not formalised.

Thus a represented rational with even reduced denominator would refute universal \#257 at $`b=2`$. The converse is not established.

The restriction is one of application, not of proof: every supporting lemma allows an arbitrary positive $`v`$, and the general-$`v`$ conclusion is already recorded for arbitrary $`(v,h,L,F)`$. **Missing step.** Instantiate the recorded generic theorem at $`F=\{a,b\}`$, $`L=\mathrm{lcm}\,a\,b`$, $`h=`$ multiplicative order of $`2`$ mod $`v`$, giving $`\rho(A) \ge

The constant $`B`$ may depend on the fixed support and the other parameters. More basically, if $`a_0`$ is any positive element of $`A`$, then each block of $`a_0`$ consecutive integers contains a multiple of $`a_0`$. Every zero window of $`c_A`$ therefore has length at most $`a_0-1`$, whether or not $`X_A(2)`$ is rational. For a fixed nonempty support, the displayed logarithmic bound thus gives no additional restriction. A proposed alternative between super-logarithmic zero windows and general block certificates cannot split this class: the first branch is already impossible.

**Different restrictions.** Two gaps. (i) On the support: the bouquet class strictly generalises pairwise-coprime supports but still demands globally pairwise-coprime, summable petals; it inherits the exclusion of the primes noted in the preceding observation and adds nothing in the divisor-dense regime. (ii) On the selector: the tail-selection hypothesis must hold at every precision and is unproved. Despite the name of the source file, it contains no dichotomy theorem.

For the class: the assertion that every infinite $`A`$ admits a bouquet structure is *false* (take $`A=`$ all multiples of 6: there is no coprime petal decomposition).

[`irrational_erdosSupportSeries_eventuallyPeriodic`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean#L11604). **Conclusion.** $`\forall b\ge2\ \forall m{>}0\ \forall N_0`$: $`A`$ infinite and $`m`$-periodic above $`N_0`$ $`\Rightarrow`$ irrational. Plus: the class of supports with irrational series is closed under finite symmetric difference in both directions. The statement follows from the periodic theorem of Luca and Tachiya \[lucatachiya2017, Theorem A, p. 139\].

**Scope of the hypothesis.** The theorem allows every positive period and every finite starting threshold. It still requires an eventually periodic support, so it does not include all aperiodic supports covered by the other criteria in this record. Finite symmetric difference preserves eventual periodicity. Thus the finite-perturbation argument alone cannot extend this theorem to an aperiodic tail; a further hypothesis or argument is needed.

**Missing step.** A “locally periodic at cofinally many scales” version; $`\forall q{>}0\
\exists N\ \exists m\le f(N)`$ such that $`A\cap[N,N{+}L]`$ is $`m`$-periodic for $`L`$ large enough that the periodic sieve manufactures one block certificate. The periodic argument already needs periodicity only across the certificate window, so this is the closest genuine widening; but proving that periodic windows exist at unboundedly many scales for arbitrary $`A`$ is a new statement.

*Observation 241* (The reduced denominator in a gap criterion). [`irrational_erdosSum_of_lcm_gap`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean#L5883) (instances [`irrational_erdosSum_factorial_support`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean#L6035), [`irrational_erdosSum_two_pow_support`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean#L6059)). Let $`A=\{a_0<a_1<\cdots\}\subseteq\mathbb N_{>0}`$, let $`b\ge2`$ be an integer, and write the first $`k`$ terms in lowest terms as
``` math
S_k=\sum_{j<k}\frac1{b^{a_j}-1}=\frac{P_k}{Q_k},\qquad Q_k\ge1.
```
A sufficient irrationality condition is
``` math
Q_k b^{-a_k}\longrightarrow0,
 \quad\text{equivalently}\quad a_k-\log_b Q_k\longrightarrow+\infty.
```
The next omitted exponent is $`a_k`$, not the last exponent included in $`S_k`$. Since $`a_{k+j}\ge a_k+j`$, the positive omitted tail obeys
``` math
0<X_A(b)-S_k
 \le\left(\frac{b}{b-1}\right)^2b^{-a_k}.
```
If $`X_A(b)=p/q`$ were rational, positivity would give $`qQ_k(X_A(b)-S_k)\ge1`$. The displayed tail estimate contradicts this under the proposed condition. This is the denominator-times-error argument in [`irrational_of_den_mul_abs_sub_tendsto_zero`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean#L5371), with all indices specified.

For $`L_k=\operatorname{lcm}(a_0,\ldots,a_{k-1})`$ one has $`Q_k\mid b^{L_k}-1`$, hence $`\log_b Q_k<L_k`$. Thus the earlier condition $`a_k-L_k\to\infty`$ suffices. Using actual reduced denominators can improve this estimate, but requires an *upper* bound for $`Q_k`$ relative to $`b^{a_k}`$. A surviving-divisor *lower* bound does not provide that upper bound. In particular, the divisibility statement in [Lean source](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/RationalDenominatorSurvival.lean#L17) and the lower bound in [`upperHalfMersenneProduct_lower_bound`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/MersenneShadowDenominatorGrowth.lean#L60) do not alone establish the proposed condition for an arbitrary support. No such condition is proved here for the remaining dense supports.

Because the criterion is an equivalence and the orbit is unique, this is logically equivalent to the obligation; its value is to name the single object (the tempered carry orbit of $`c_{A}`$) whose non-existence is the entire content, for every $`A`$ at once.

Let $`A\subseteq\mathbb{N}_{>0}`$ be infinite, let $`c\ge0`$ and $`v\ge1`$ be integers, and let $`u(n)`$ be positive integers satisfying
``` math
u(n+1)+v c_A(c+n+1)=2u(n)\qquad(n\ge0).
```
For a finite $`F\subseteq A`$ and a common multiple $`L`$ of its elements with *$`L>c`$*, put $`n=L-c-1\ge0`$. Directly from the recurrence,
``` math
2u(L-c-1)=u(L-c)+v c_A(L)\ge1+v|F|.
```
This argument uses positivity of the next state, not an assumed tail representation or a limit condition. A general positive solution may also have an exponentially growing homogeneous part. The condition $`L>c`$ ensures that the coefficient row really is $`L`$; truncated natural-number subtraction cannot replace it.

Finite subsets $`F`$ of arbitrarily large size, followed by positive common multiples exceeding $`c`$, prove that $`u`$ is unbounded. In the tempered case the separate identity $`u(n)=v\sum_{r\ge1}c_A(c+n+r)2^{-r}`$ gives $`u(n)\le v(c+n+2)`$. Unboundedness is consistent with this linear upper bound and with $`u(n)/2^n\to0`$. A contradiction would require an incompatible upper estimate at the same chosen indices.

For every real $`x\in[0,E]`$, not just rational targets, one has
``` math
x\notin\mathcal A\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 \exists m\ge1\ \exists D\subseteq\{1,\ldots,m-1\},\qquad
 X_D(2)+R_m<x<X_D(2)+w_m.
```
Here $`R_m=\sum_{j>m}w_j`$. The implication to the right has a short greedy proof. If $`x\notin\mathcal A`$, choose the first $`m`$ with $`r_m(x)>R_m`$ using Theorem <a href="#thm:greedy-survival" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:greedy-survival">10</a>. Since $`r_0(x)=x\le E`$, we have $`m\ge1`$ and $`r_{m-1}(x)\le R_{m-1}=w_m+R_m`$. A take at $`m`$ would leave a remainder at most $`R_m`$, so this step must be a skip. Thus $`R_m<r_{m-1}(x)<w_m`$, giving the displayed gap with the greedy prefix $`D`$.

Conversely, the displayed gap contains no achievable value. A support with prefix $`D`$ either skips $`m`$, giving value at most $`X_D(2)+R_m`$, or takes $`m`$, giving value at least $`X_D(2)+w_m`$. A different prefix first differs at some $`j<m`$; the inequality $`w_j>R_j`$ orders its entire continuation interval strictly on one side of the interval with prefix $`D`$. Both gap endpoints themselves are achievable, by the supports $`D\cup\{m+1,m+2,\ldots\}`$ and $`D\cup\{m\}`$. Consequently no parity argument or irrationality assertion about $`E`$ is needed for this ordinary general-target dichotomy. The restriction to $`[0,E]`$ is essential to this formulation: targets outside the convex hull are already excluded and need not lie in an internal gap. The general-target equivalence and both endpoint constructions are Lean-checked in [`paper_general_target_gap`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/168bf6727758f918a430ef056a1c93d3160b53a6/lean/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/PaperCompleteR20/GeneralTargetGap.lean#L173).

Luca and Tachiya’s theorem already gives irrationality for every nonzero periodic weight \[lucatachiya2017, Theorem A, p. 139\].

**Different restrictions.** Two mismatches. (i) Periodicity of the weight is still required; this is the signed version of the periodic-support theorem and keeps its periodicity hypothesis. (ii) The one-sidedness clause is automatic for \#257 (a $`0/1`$ support indicator gives $`c_{A}\ge0`$), so the sign conditions add nothing here; they were designed for the signed \#249 argument. The genuinely transferable content is the dichotomy shape itself: irrational-or-$`b`$-adically- terminating, terminating branch killable by a positive far tail.

**Missing step.** An aperiodic version of the dichotomy; for arbitrary $`A`$, either $`X_{A}(2)`$ is irrational or $`2^k\cdot`$it is an integer. For arbitrary infinite $`A`$, exclusion of the terminating branch is itself an additional unproved assertion; finite-support odd-denominator parity does not pass automatically to an infinite limit. An aperiodic dichotomy together with a valid terminating-branch exclusion would close the obligation. Periodicity is used only to manufacture the full-block certificates, so removing it again requires the missing supply of certificates for arbitrary supports.

**Theorem 246** (A: a sufficient lower bound at every reset). *Assume that $`|\mathrm{rem}(r+1)-2^{r+1}|>2^{(r+5)/2}`$ for every upper or middle reset $`r\ge10`$. Then $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$.*

*Here is the role of the constants. Put
``` math
B(r)=2^{\lfloor(r+4)/2\rfloor}+2r+3.
```
For $`r\ge10`$, one has $`B(r)^2\le2^{r+5}`$. A right branch at the first crossing of the largest omitted rank $`r`$ would force $`|\Delta_{r+1}|\le B(r)`$, by tracing the exact affine recurrence back to that reset. The assumed strict lower bound excludes this crossing. The largest-skip induction then gives half-membership. The hypothesis concerns every actual reset beyond the threshold; neither a long finite check nor an asserted run-length asymptotic supplies it.*

</div>

<div class="rem">

*Remark 247* (B: rigidity of dangerous resets). A dangerous reset (one within $`2^{(r+5)/2}`$ of the square-root escape threshold) that is preceded by a long pure R-run pins the deviation at the preceding reset to one of at most two adjacent pulse-determined integers, where one might expect a free real number: the affine excess recurrence (Observation <a href="#obs:affine-excess-recurrence" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="obs:affine-excess-recurrence">205</a>) is exact, so once the run length and the pulse word are fixed, $`w_{r_0+1}`$ has no remaining degree of freedom. Observation <a href="#obs:dangerous-reset-rigidity" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="obs:dangerous-reset-rigidity">283</a> states the hypotheses and the run-length threshold. Consequently a chain of $`n`$ consecutive dangerous resets with long runs is a tower of $`n{-}1`$ nested exact integer conditions, none free to vary once the pulse stream is fixed. Failure of square-root escape therefore requires such an integer-coincidence tower. No probability model is supplied, so these conditions do not by themselves make dangerous resets unlikely; the open step is excluding the two pinned values. This is an ordinary argument.

**Theorem 248** (C ; the one-sided finite decision boundary). *The equivalence of Theorem <a href="#thm:greedy-survival-record" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:greedy-survival-record">34</a> separates two logically different kinds of evidence. A fatal greedy gap found at a finite rank is a finite certificate that $`1/2\notin\mathcal A`$. By contrast, membership requires survival at every rank; the corpus supplies no finite certificate that the orbit survives forever and no completion theorem turning a long surviving prefix into membership.*

*The reset-crossing hypotheses, truncation-rung ladder, and sharp-capacity inequalities feed sufficient conditions for membership. They are not proved equivalent to one another, nor is failure to find one at a given depth evidence of survival. Consequently these searches give at most a semi-decision procedure for *nonmembership of the specific value $`1/2`$*. Halting does not prove the universal statement in \#257, and non-halting does not prove that $`1/2`$ is represented. In particular, neither truth nor falsity of the universal problem is shown semi-decidable here.

#### Four limitations of the stated implications

The following conditions are equivalent to their target statements within the specified scope. An equivalence may still be useful by exposing a quantity that is easier to estimate. What it does not supply is a proof of that estimate, or a strict weakening of the logical obligation.

For the greedy support $`A=G`$ of $`1/2`$ specifically, this bound is logically *equivalent* to the theorem’s own conclusion $`X_{A}(2)=1/2`$, not a strictly weaker sufficient condition. This follows from the exact residual identity of Lemma <a href="#lem:collapse-mech" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:collapse-mech">15</a>, the unconditional square-root tail bound ([`binaryCoeffTail_supportCoeff_le_two_sqrt_add_four`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusCarry.lean#L290)), the unconditional tail-nonnegativity lemma ([`binaryCoeffTail_nonneg`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GenericTailOrbitRigidity.lean#L78)), and the greedy-specific fact $`X_{A}(2)\le1/2`$. **The scope limit is exact:** this equivalence does *not* extend to every $`A`$ with $`1\notin A`$; dropping the greedy-specific fact yields only that the bound is equivalent to $`\delta\le0`$ (a one-sided condition), not to $`\delta=0`$. For the related hypothesis [`GreedyHalfCarryCofinalStripReturn`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CofinalStripReturn.lean#L76), the former gap between the real and the integer square root is removed by restricting cofinal witness depths to perfect squares. Any remaining gap lies in the hypothesis itself, not in rounding.

<div class="rem">

*Remark 250* (What the terminal carry condition proves). [`HalfCarryCofinalTerminalOnlyStrip`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TerminalOnlyCofinal.lean#L34) at the original strip constant is logically equivalent to $`1/2\in\ensuremath{\mathcal A}`$ after restricting cofinal witness depths to perfect squares and using the recorded tail bound. The square-root conversion raises no further issue; the open content is the hypothesis itself.

*Remark 251* (Positive greedy skips and half-membership). As noted above, the positivity conjunct of [`CofinalPositiveHalfGreedySkips`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusSkipRowCofinal.lean#L22) holds unconditionally, by parity and greedy nonnegativity ([Lean source](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusCriticalCapacityCofinal.lean#L138)). The hypothesis therefore says exactly that the greedy rule for $`1/2`$ skips infinitely many ranks, which is *equivalent* to $`1/2\in\ensuremath{\mathcal A}`$ ([Lean source](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean#L2514)). A proof or disproof of this statement settles the half-target question, and conversely; it is not an intermediate step toward it.

</div>

<div class="rem">

*Remark 252* (Scope discipline for the equivalence class). Each equivalence uses its stated domain. The centred-carry upper bound concerns the actual greedy support $`G`$, not every support omitting $`1`$. The cofinal terminal condition already works with the original constant $`4`$, because perfect-square depths avoid a rounding loss. The positive-skip equivalence is stated here at the target $`1/2`$; extending it to another target requires checking the target-dependent arguments. None of these qualifications supplies the still-missing unbounded sequence of witnesses.

### Hypothesis-specific obstructions

The examples in this section test particular proposed implications for the reset estimate. Some give counterexamples in abstract recurrence models; others compute an exact finite orbit or compare two quantitative bounds. An abstract counterexample is not a state of the actual greedy orbit unless that correspondence is established. Additional arithmetic hypotheses may therefore change the conclusion.

Throughout, $`\mathrm{rem}(s)`$ is the quotient-row remainder, $`\lambda_n := \Delta_n/2^n`$ the normalized seam deviation of Theorem <a href="#thm:dynamics" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:dynamics">40</a>, and $`\mathcal A`$ the Mersenne achievement set. Reset square-root escape from row 10 is the statement $`|\mathrm{rem}(r+1)-2^{r+1}| > 2^{(r+5)/2}`$ for every reset row $`r\ge 10`$. It is a sufficient input for the cited half-membership argument, not a necessary condition for every possible proof.

#### Four tested approaches to the reset estimate

<div id="obs:prime-doubling" class="obs">

*Observation 253* (Prime steps can occur within a bounded drift window). **Route as conceived.** The universal recursion $`K(M+1) = 2K(M) - (\tau(M+1)-1)`$ doubles at every step and subtracts the divisor-excess $`\tau(M+1)-1`$. At a prime $`M+1=p`$, $`\tau(p)=2`$ so the subtracted term is $`1`$; the naive hope is that primality of an index forces the step to be "almost pure doubling," and that prime density (Chebyshev/PNT-scale) then bounds how long a run of near-pure-doubling steps can last, which would bound the danger run-length $`L_r`$ in the right-branch recurrence in Theorem <a href="#thm:dynamics" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:dynamics">40</a>. The upper branch has a different, adjacent-spacing correction, so a run-length argument cannot use the discarded uniform-error formula across resets.

**A finite test.** Use the skip set of the quotient row $`n=607`$ from Section <a href="#ssec:seam-model" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ssec:seam-model">5.4</a>, and define the frozen-row drift

5,\ 5,\ 4,\ 4,\ 6,\ 2,\ 3,\ 4,\ 5,\ 2,\ 3.
```
There are eleven values and ten transitions. The indices $`607`$, $`613`$, and $`617`$ are prime. For $`M+1\ge607`$ the recurrence is
``` math
J_{607}(M+1)=2J_{607}(M)
 -\bigl(\tau(M+1)-1-c_{\mathrm{Skip}_{607}}(M+1)\bigr).
```
At a prime index the last coefficient is $`1`$. The composite-index coefficients can compensate for those prime steps, as the displayed values illustrate. This table is a new finite arithmetic check; the longer earlier run search was not repeated.

**Scope.** Primality at some indices does not force this drift to leave a small interval immediately. The example supplies no universal run-length bound and no statistical conclusion about prime indices. It also does not exclude a proof that combines prime counts with quantitative information about the intervening divisor counts.

<div id="obs:parity-squares" class="obs">

*Observation 254* (Parity and perfect squares in the recurrence). **Route as conceived.** $`K(M)`$ is even exactly when $`M`$ is a perfect square (a true, provable fact). The hope was to use this parity law to forbid certain residues or run patterns in the digit stream of $`K`$, since parity constraints are a classical first attack on digit-run questions.

**What the parity calculation says.** The recurrence implies $`J(M+1)\equiv\delta(M+1)\pmod2`$ for every integer forcing sequence. For $`K`$, the additional arithmetic fact that $`\tau(M)`$ is odd exactly at squares gives the stated parity pattern. One should not call that pattern a property of every forcing sequence, or say that it excludes no residue: at each fixed index it does specify the parity.

**Scope.** Restating a parity consequence of a known recurrence does not add a new independent constraint. To turn it into a run-length bound would require further information about the sizes or arrangement of the forcing terms. No argument here rules out using parity together with such information.

**Use of the observation.** The parity law does constrain $`K(M)`$ at each specified index and is a useful check on any proposed run pattern. The missing implication is from this residue information to a quantitative bound on run lengths. No such implication is proved by the parity calculation alone.

<div id="obs:irrationality-measure" class="obs">

*Observation 255* (What the denominator estimate does not give). One proposed separation argument would prevent $`\sum_{d\in\mathrm{Skip}_n}x_d`$ from approximating $`C:=E-\tfrac32=0.1066951524152917\ldots`$ at scale $`2^{-3n/2}`$. An irrationality-measure bound is relevant only after relating the reduced denominator of that finite sum to $`n`$.

For $`n\ge2`$ and $`\mathrm{Skip}_n\subseteq\{2,\ldots,n-1\}`$, its reduced denominator $`D_n`$ satisfies
``` math
\log_2 D_n\le\sum_{d\in\mathrm{Skip}_n}\log_2(2^d-1)
 \le\sum_{d\in\mathrm{Skip}_n}d
 \le\frac{n(n-1)}2-1.
```
The middle inequality is strict when the skip set is nonempty. This is an upper bound; it is not an asymptotic formula for $`D_n`$. In particular, cardinality alone does not justify an asymptotic of order $`n^2/4`$.

Zudilin proves $`\mu(E)\le2.46497868\ldots`$ \[zudilin2004, Theorem 1, p. 154\]. Rational translation preserves the irrationality exponent, so for any fixed $`\nu>2.46497868\ldots`$ there is a constant $`c_\nu>0`$ such that every reduced rational $`p/q`$, with $`q\ge1`$, satisfies $`|C-p/q|\ge c_\nu q^{-\nu}`$. Using only the displayed denominator estimate therefore gives
``` math
\left|C-\sum_{d\in\mathrm{Skip}_n}x_d\right|
 \ge c_\nu\,2^{-\nu(n(n-1)/2-1)}.
```
This guaranteed lower bound is eventually smaller than $`2^{-3n/2}`$, so it does not prove the desired separation. A sharper estimate for the actual reduced denominators, or an approximation result using additional structure of these numerators, could change the comparison. Neither is excluded by this calculation.

Retaining only the parity of an input coefficient leaves considerable freedom. In $`e'=2e+c`$, every incoming integer $`e`$ admits the odd choice $`c=-1-2e`$, which gives $`e'=-1`$. The next proposition uses the same centred-remainder construction when more unit bits and a valuation are prescribed.

**Proposition 256** (Centred completion of fixed-precision 2-adic data). *Fix $`u\ge1`$ and a finite list $`(v_i,a_i)_{0\le i<m}`$, where $`v_i\ge0`$ are integers and the integers $`a_i`$ are odd. For every initial integer $`e_0`$, there are integers $`z_i,e_{i+1}`$ such that
``` math
e_{i+1}=2e_i+2^{v_i}(a_i+2^u z_i),\qquad
 |e_{i+1}|\le2^{v_i+u-1}\qquad(0\le i<m).
```
Thus one may prescribe the valuation and $`u`$ bits of the odd unit of each input coefficient while keeping every *successor* state in its stated centred interval. The initial state is arbitrary.*

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* For a single step, put $`M=2^{v_i+u}`$ and $`R=M/2`$, and choose
``` math
e_{i+1}=\bigl((2e_i+2^{v_i}a_i+R)\bmod M\bigr)-R.
```
The remainder convention $`0\le x\bmod M<M`$ gives $`-R\le e_{i+1}<R`$. Also $`e_{i+1}-2e_i\equiv2^{v_i}a_i\pmod M`$, so this difference has the required form $`2^{v_i}(a_i+2^u z_i)`$. Repeating the construction proves the finite-list statement. It uses no relation between the freely chosen quotients $`z_i`$ at different steps. ◻

They concern this unrestricted congruence model, not coefficients already fixed by a divisor-count sequence. Fixed-precision data alone cannot exclude every completion in this model. The proposition does not show that the completion comes from a Mersenne support, satisfies additional arithmetic relations, or belongs to the particular greedy orbit. In particular, it is not a general obstruction to every fixed-window argument for Problem 249 or 257.

These observations have separate scopes: a finite prime-window example, a parity consequence of a known recurrence, an insufficient denominator estimate, and a completion theorem for specified fixed-precision symbols. They do not exhaust the possible approaches to the reset estimate or force every proof to use digit-carry machinery. The next section studies that machinery because it gives explicit conditional implications, not because other methods have been ruled out.

#### Excluding particular final dyadic intervals

The two-sided bound $`\min(\mathrm{rem}(s),\mathrm{overshoot}(s))\le2^s`$ for all $`s\ge5`$ is conditional. It propagates by induction from a local hypothesis which at every row excludes three specified integer values on the middle branch and imposes one further inequality on the right branch:
``` math
\begin{gathered}
 s\ge5,\quad\text{no carry and a middle transition}
 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad C_s\notin\{-3,-2,-1\};\\
 s\ge5,\quad\text{no carry and a right transition},\quad
 \mathrm{overshoot}(s)\le2^s\\
 \Longrightarrow\quad\mathrm{charge}(s)\le2^{s+2}.
 \end{gathered}
```
Here $`C_s=4\,\mathrm{rem}(s)-p_s^- -4`$. On a middle transition, $`\mathrm{rem}(s+1)-2^{s+1}=C_s+4`$; on a right transition, $`\mathrm{rem}(s+1)=C_s-2^{s+1}`$. Thus $`C_s`$ must not be identified with the next row’s centred remainder.

**Proposition 257** (The upper (carries) successor needs no exceptional-cell exclusion). *Let $`s\ge5`$ and suppose the upper branch occurs at row $`s`$, that is, the transition at row $`s`$ is on branch $`\mathrm U`$ of Theorem <a href="#thm:dynamics" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:dynamics">40</a>. Then
``` math
\mathrm{rem}(s+1)\le2^{s+1}.
```
Indeed, the reset identity expresses $`2^{s+1}`$ as $`\mathrm{rem}(s+1)`$ plus a nonnegative reset charge. Thus the upper branch needs no exceptional-value exclusion for the next-row two-sided invariant. This conclusion concerns that induction step, not the absence of upper transitions on the orbit.*

**Theorem 258** ($`C_D=-3`$ is impossible at the final middle transition, $`D\ge 13`$). *Consider a hypothetical *final middle transition*: a middle transition at row $`D\ge 13`$ ($`\lnot\mathrm{carries}`$, and the middle-branch inequality $`4\mathrm{rem}(D)+\mathrm{gap}-\mathrm{belowPulse} < \mathrm{terminalWeight}`$ holds at $`D`$), followed by an all-right tail forever after ($`\forall s\ge D{+}1`$, $`\mathrm{seamGreedyWord}(s+1) =
\mathrm{seamGreedyWord}(s).\mathrm{extend}\ \mathrm{true}`$). Under these assumptions,
``` math
\mathrm{belowPulse}(D) + 2 \;\le\; 4\cdot\mathrm{rem}(D),
```
i.e. $`C_D \ge -2`$ ; the cell $`C_D=-3`$ (and every more negative value) is excluded.*

***Proof of the bound.** The all-right-tail assumption puts the terminal-augmented finite prefix strictly above $`1/2`$. Consequently the producer carry is below its complete incidence tail, or equivalently $`Z_D<1+1/(2^D-1)`$, where $`Z_D=\mathrm{rem}(D)-\mathrm{seamWordFloorError}(D)`$. The lower bound uses the other endpoint: under the same tail assumption, the finite value at $`D`$ plus the complete Mersenne tail remains below $`1/2`$. The exact scaled remainder identity therefore gives
``` math
Z_D>4^D\sum_{e>D}\frac1{2^e-1}-2^D>\frac13.
```
The last inequality follows by retaining the first two geometric channels of the complete Mersenne tail. Put $`E_D=\mathrm{seamWordFloorError}(D)`$. Pulse absorption gives $`\mathrm{belowPulse}(D)\le4E_D`$, so
``` math
4\,\mathrm{rem}(D)-\mathrm{belowPulse}(D)
 \ge4(\mathrm{rem}(D)-E_D)=4Z_D>\frac43.
```
The left side is an integer, hence is at least $`2`$, as required. The upper threshold inequality alone would not give this lower bound.*

***Scope.** This excludes $`C_D=-3`$ at a middle row $`D\ge13`$ under the additional all-right-tail assumption. The general induction requires exclusion of all three cells at every middle row, not just under this extra hypothesis, together with its right-branch bound. The two statements share the same coordinate $`C_D`$ but have different hypotheses. Theorem <a href="#thm:cd-neg3-impossible" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:cd-neg3-impossible">258</a> is universal over rows satisfying the additional all-right-tail assumption; it does not assert that such a row exists. The induction hypothesis concerns every middle row, without that tail assumption. Excluding $`C_D=-3`$ in the former statement therefore does not supply the exclusion required in the latter. **Object or representation:** about the *object* under the stated hypothesis ; a genuine arithmetic consequence of the all-right-tail assumption via the fatal-gap orbit, not a coordinate artifact.*

**Corollary 259** (Only $`C_D\in\{-2,-1\}`$ remain among the exceptional dyadic cells). *At a final middle row $`D\ge13`$, Theorem <a href="#thm:cd-neg3-impossible" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:cd-neg3-impossible">258</a> removes $`-3`$ from the exceptional set $`\{-3,-2,-1\}`$, leaving $`-2,-1`$ *within that set*. It does not assert $`C_D\in\{-2,-1\}`$: nonnegative values have not been excluded. Proposition <a href="#prop:upper-unconditional" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:upper-unconditional">257</a> handles upper transitions in the two-sided induction; it supplies no additional restriction on a middle coordinate.

<div id="rem:tail-dominance-open" class="rem">

*Remark 260* (A sufficient tail inequality and its source). Let $`U_D`$ be the finite set of exponents selected by the below word at row $`D`$, and put $`F_D=U_D\cup\{D\}`$. With $`c_{F_D}(n)=\#\{d\in F_D:d\mid n\}`$, define
``` math
\Theta_D:=\sum_{j\ge1}c_{F_D}(2D+2+j)2^{-j}.
```
This is a tail sum, not a ratio. Since $`0\le c_{F_D}(n)\le |F_D|`$, it satisfies $`0\le\Theta_D\le |F_D|`$. The integer $`C_D=4\,\mathrm{rem}(D)-\mathrm{belowPulse}(D)-4`$ is the producer carry in the cited source. Under the final-middle and all-right-tail assumptions, that source proves $`C_D<\Theta_D`$: [`Erdos249257.middleProducer_allRight_forces_carry_lt_tail`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L1814).

An inequality in the opposite direction would exclude such a final middle transition. The following sufficient condition retains the exception already handled by Theorem <a href="#thm:cd-neg3-impossible" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:cd-neg3-impossible">258</a>:
``` math
\textbf{(TD)}\qquad
 \forall D\ge13,\quad
 \bigl(D\text{ is a middle row and }C_D\ne-3\bigr)
 \ \Longrightarrow\ \Theta_D<C_D.
```
Because $`\Theta_D\ge0`$, this condition in particular excludes $`C_D=-2`$ and $`C_D=-1`$. It requires an inequality at the other indicated middle rows as well, so it is not merely a reformulation of excluding two integer values. Nor does it supply the separate right-branch hypothesis used in the two-sided induction.

This is the reduced middle tail condition of Part III, and half-membership follows from it ([`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_middleProducerTailEscapeExceptNegThree`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderLastProducerContradiction.lean#L436)). The inequality itself is not established here. Its role is a conditional implication, not a newly identified necessary condition.

The two more concrete sufficient bounds in Theorem <a href="#thm:middle-producer-escape" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:middle-producer-escape">50</a> imply the tail inequality even without the exception. Their Lean forms are [`Erdos249257.SeamMiddleProducerCardEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L279) and [`Erdos249257.SeamMiddleProducerRowEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L1769). The cardinality condition is
``` math
|U_D|+\mathrm{belowPulse}(D)+5<4\,\mathrm{rem}(D).
```
It gives $`|F_D|=|U_D|+1<C_D`$, hence $`\Theta_D<C_D`$. The simpler row condition $`D\le\mathrm{rem}(D)`$ is stronger: $`\mathrm{belowPulse}(D)\le2|U_D|`$ and $`|U_D|\le D-2`$ give $`|U_D|+\mathrm{belowPulse}(D)+5\le3D-1<4D`$. The corresponding half-membership implication is [`Erdos249257.half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_middleProducerCardEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L2364). No converse between these sufficient conditions is claimed.

**Proposition 261** (A finite-state restriction for the stated pulse family). *For a “balanced pulse” family at location $`m\ge2`$ (radius $`\rho=\lfloor(m{+}1)/2\rfloor`$, parameters $`0\le r\le\rho`$, moving mass between positions $`m`$ and $`m{+}1`$ with the weighted total $`2c(m)+c(m{+}1)=2\rho`$ of the two coefficients fixed), if a predecessor state is constant across the whole family, then no function $`\mathrm{decode}:\mathrm{State}\to\mathbb N`$ can recover the parameter $`r`$ from $`\mathrm{state}(r)`$ for every $`r`$. The family has exactly $`\rho+1=\lfloor(m{+}1)/2\rfloor+1`$ members, so the fan-out is unbounded in $`m`$.

**Proposition 263** (Finite computation and half-membership). *No finite positive-index Boolean support has value exactly $`1/2`$: the reduced denominator of any finite Mersenne subset-sum is provably **odd** (each $`2^n-1`$ is odd), while $`1/2`$ needs an even denominator. Separately, $`\mathsf{CertifiedGreedyMersenneDeath}`$ is a finite-depth certificate of $`x\notin\mathcal A`$, obtained by decidable tests on rational input.

It records survival of that finite test, not survival at every depth.*

***Scope.** Any support representing $`1/2`$, if it exists, must be infinite. This follows from denominator parity, independently of the certificate search. The search supplies a different fact: a successful exclusion certificate proves nonmembership, whereas its absence in a bounded search does not prove membership or rationality. The same distinction must be checked separately for any other certificate family.*

*Consequently, the required certificate supply is: for every $`h_0\ge1`$ and every lower bound $`N_0`$, there exist $`m\ge1`$, $`N\ge N_0`$ and a finite test length $`K`$ excluding integrality for $`(mh_0,N)`$. The unbounded choice of $`N`$ is essential; a counterexample before the unknown eventual threshold does not exclude an eventual period. It is sufficient instead to obtain such certificates for $`h=\mathrm{lcm}(1,\ldots,t)`$ with both $`t`$ and $`N`$ exceeding arbitrary prescribed lower bounds. The supplied finite theorem excludes the tail differences for $`1\le h\le16`$ at $`(N,L)=(14,9)`$, and hence excludes rational values whose reduced denominator divides $`2^{14}(2^h-1)`$ for one of those $`h`$. It does not establish the unbounded certificate supply.*

***Scope.** The Lean declarations used in this comparison concern the totient series of Problem 249. Their carry recurrences may suggest constructions for Problem 257, but applying them there requires a new argument for the divisor transform of its chosen support. The totient-specific theorems do not supply that argument.*

**Lemma 265** (Denominator complement survives scaling). *For $`x:\mathbb Q`$, $`c:\mathbb Z`$, $`H:\mathbb N`$: if $`H\mid x.\mathrm{den}`$ and $`(c\cdot x).\mathrm{den}\mid H`$ ; i.e. multiplying by the integer $`c`$ shrinks the displayed denominator down *into* $`H`$ ; then the **complementary** denominator factor $`x.\mathrm{den}/H`$ divides $`c`$:
``` math
H\mid x.\mathrm{den} \ \land\ (c\cdot x).\mathrm{den}\mid H \implies x.\mathrm{den}/H \mid |c|.
```
Equivalently, writing $`D=x.\mathrm{den}/H`$, we have $`D\mid c`$, so $`t=c/D`$ is an integer and $`Hcx=t\,x.\mathrm{num}`$. Here $`H>0`$ follows from $`H\mid x.\mathrm{den}`$, since the reduced denominator is positive.*

***Scope.** This is elementary rational arithmetic, independent of the problem. If $`c\ne0`$, divisibility gives the size bound $`|c|\ge x.\mathrm{den}/H`$. The nonzero condition is essential: $`c=0`$ clears every denominator and satisfies the divisibility conclusion without any positive lower bound on $`|c|`$. The lemma therefore constrains denominator clearing by a nonzero bounded multiplier, not arbitrary multiplication. **Object or representation:** about a *representation* ; pure denominator bookkeeping for $`\mathbb Q`$, with zero problem-specific content; the upstream primitive is the domain-neutral extraction this lemma builds on.*

#### The final-skip band formula, and what it does not show

**Definition 267** (Upper-reset dyadic band escape). At each upper-reset row $`d\ge13`$, write $`E_d=4\,\mathrm{overshoot}(d)+\mathrm{abovePulse}(d)`$ for the reset expression in the preceding transition formulas. The condition is

Thus $`E_d`$ must avoid the interval $`(2^{d-j+1}-2(d+j),\,2^{d-j+1}]`$ at every indicated scale.

In words: at every upper-reset row $`d\ge13`$, the reset charge must avoid a linear-width forbidden band immediately below every dyadic threshold $`2^{d-j+1}`$, for every $`j\le d`$ simultaneously.

**Proposition 268** (Quantifier collapse: one critical index suffices, not $`d{+}1`$). *Let $`d,E\in\mathbb N`$ and assume $`E\le2^{d+1}`$. Then the purely combinatorial statement $`\mathsf{DyadicBandEscape}(d,E) \iff \exists j,\ \mathsf{CriticalDyadicBandIndex}(d,E,j)\land
E+2(d+j)\le 2^{d-j+1}`$ collapses the $`\forall j\in[0,d]`$ band-avoidance condition (formally $`d{+}1`$ separate inequalities) to checking exactly *one* nearest-boundary index $`j`$. The range assumption ensures that a dyadic threshold lies at or above $`E`$. Choose the smallest such threshold: smaller thresholds are already below $`E`$, while larger thresholds have narrower forbidden bands. Without the range assumption all bands escape automatically when $`E>2^{d+1}`$, but no critical index exists; $`(d,E)=(0,3)`$ is the smallest example. Specialised to the concrete seam reset charge, $`\mathsf{SeamUpperResetCriticalBandEscape}`$ is proved logically *equivalent* to Definition <a href="#defn:band-escape" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="defn:band-escape">267</a>’s hypothesis.

The linked certificate proves the condition in Definition <a href="#defn:band-escape" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="defn:band-escape">267</a> for each reset index $`13\le d\le30`$.

*Remark 270* (What this does *not* show). Definition <a href="#defn:band-escape" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="defn:band-escape">267</a> is a $`\forall d\ge13`$ statement; Observation <a href="#cert:band-through-31" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="cert:band-through-31">269</a> is a finite verification in the cited Lean source for $`13\le d\le30`$. **The finite certificate does not establish the universal hypothesis.** Nothing here proves the band condition for all $`d\ge13`$; it is the unproved hypothesis of Theorem <a href="#thm:upper-reset-band" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:upper-reset-band">53</a>, stated here in its own form.

The finite theorem supplies no reset index beyond $`30`$. It therefore does not prove that the orbit avoids the band at unboundedly many reset indices, let alone at every reset. The universal band condition remains an unproved sufficient hypothesis.

For the branch convention of Theorem <a href="#thm:dynamics" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:dynamics">40</a>, direct integer recomputation at reset-test indices $`6\le r\le2500`$ gives $`605`$ middle and $`604`$ upper resets, hence $`1209`$ resets. There are $`1286`$ right transitions. The earlier reported count $`1264`$ does not agree with this convention. The recomputation checks the sign inequalities at these resets, the square-root bound at resets $`r\ge10`$, and the displayed band condition at upper resets $`r\ge13`$, with no failures. This remains a finite ordinary computation, distinct from the cited Lean theorem for $`13\le r\le30`$ and from an assertion at every later reset.

### Unproved inputs for the recorded implications

The preceding parts prove support criteria, finite identities and conditional implications. They do not decide the universal problem or either rational target. This section states the remaining hypotheses for particular implications and compares them with the estimates already available. Ordinary arguments, reported finite computations and unproved proposals are distinguished in the text. No single necessary obstruction is claimed to account for every unsuccessful estimate.

For example, the first two weighted divisor counts after $`M=3`$ give $`(\tau(4)-1)/2+(\tau(5)-1)/4=5/4`$. The finite weighted divisor sum below records the same calculation for any starting index and length. Its role in particular universal-support criteria is discussed separately; it is not a proved common necessary obstruction for the two problems.

<div id="defn:theta" class="defn">

**Definition 271** (The short-window divisor phase). For $`M\ge 1`$ and $`L\ge 1`$ put
``` math
\Theta_L(M)\ :=\ \sum_{i=1}^{L}\bigl(\tau(M+i)-1\bigr)\,2^{-i}\ \in\ \mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0},
```
where $`\tau`$ is the number-of-divisors function, so that $`\tau(n)-1=\#\{d\ge 2: d\mid n\}`$ counts the divisors of $`n`$ other than $`1`$.

</div>

Iteration of the integer recurrence $`K(M+1)=2K(M)-(\tau(M+1)-1)`$ gives the exact identity
``` math
\Theta_L(M)=K(M)-2^{-L}K(M+L)\qquad(M\ge2,\ L\ge1).
```
Consequently $`2^L\Theta_L(M)`$ is an integer, and
``` math
\operatorname{dist}(\Theta_L(M),\mathbb Z)
 =2^{-L}\operatorname{dist}(K(M+L),2^L\mathbb Z).
```
A nonzero distance is at least $`2^{-L}`$, but nonvanishing itself requires an argument. For instance $`\Theta_1(3)=1`$ has distance zero. The identity concerns $`K`$; the quotient deviation also contains the skip-set correction in Theorem <a href="#thm:master-identity" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:master-identity">38</a>. No positive lower bound for this phase is asserted to be necessary for the universal support problem.

#### Reset bounds and finite weighted divisor sums

<a id="the-statement-needed"></a>

##### The statement needed

The first two conditions below each have a conditional implication to half-membership. No implication between them is asserted. The sign condition is weaker than a quantitative margin in its conclusion, but its relation to either membership hypothesis must still be proved.

*Form (i), the reset-deviation bound.* Write $`w_s=\mathrm{rem}(s)-2^s`$. The actual hypothesis is
``` math
\forall r\ge10\ \text{that are upper or middle resets}:\qquad
 |w_{r+1}|>2^{(r+5)/2}.
```
Equivalently, $`|\lambda_{r+1}|>2^{(3-r)/2}`$ for $`\lambda_{r+1}=w_{r+1}/2^{r+1}`$. This normalisation concerns distance of the deviation from zero, not distance of an unrelated phase from the nearest integer. The run-length estimate $`L_r<(r-3)/2`$ for resets $`r\ge31`$ is a proposed comparison target. Its exact relation to the displayed bound requires the pulse terms and the initial range $`10\le r<31`$; it is not stated as an equivalence here. A sublinear estimate gives an eventual ceiling, not automatically the required finite initial cases. An exact computation ([saved run](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/receipts/seam-orbit-200000.json)) gives a maximum run of length $`19`$ through row $`200{,}000`$, attained at row $`158{,}096`$. That observation is finite evidence, not an asymptotic theorem.

*Form (ii), band avoidance, already proved to imply membership.* For every upper reset $`d\ge13`$ and every $`j\le d`$,
``` math
2^{\,d-j+1} < E_d\quad\lor\quad E_d + 2(d+j)\ \le\ 2^{\,d-j+1},
\qquad
E_d := 4\cdot\mathrm{overshoot}_d+\mathrm{abovePulse}_d
```
([`SeamUpperResetDyadicBandEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4566)), with the conditional implication to membership [`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_upperResetDyadicBandEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4790). The $`\forall j\le d`$ band check collapses to a single nearest-boundary index per row by [`dyadicBandEscape_iff_exists_critical`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfUpperResetCriticalBand.lean#L108), and rows $`13\le d\le 30`$ are verified in the cited source by [`seamUpperResetDyadicBandEscape_through_thirty`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderUpperResetBandCertificates.lean#L78).

*Form (iii), the sign of the reset deviation.*
``` math
\forall\ \text{reset rows } r:\qquad
r \text{ is an } M\text{-reset}\Rightarrow w_{r+1}>0,
\qquad
r \text{ is a } U\text{-reset}\Rightarrow w_{r+1}<0 .
```
The finite recomputation for this record verifies these signs at all $`1209`$ resets in rows $`6`$–$`2500`$, with $`605`$ middle and $`604`$ upper resets. The upper sign follows directly from the exact branch identity below. The middle sign remains an unproved assertion about the orbit; neither sign alone gives the required lower bound on the magnitude.

##### Divisor residues and the changing skip set

Expanding each divisor count separates its residue conditions. This is a finite counting identity. It does not prescribe whether an eventual proof should be analytic, combinatorial, or use another method.

<div id="lem:odometer" class="lem">

**Lemma 272** (Divisor-residue form of the short-window phase). *For all $`M,L\ge 1`$,
``` math
\Theta_L(M)\ =\ \sum_{d\ge 2}\ \sum_{\substack{1\le i\le L\\ i\,\equiv\,-M\ (\mathrm{mod}\ d)}} 2^{-i}
\ =\ \sum_{d\ge 2}\ 2^{-i_d(M)}\cdot\frac{1-2^{-d\,m_d}}{1-2^{-d}},
```
where $`i_d(M)\in[1,d]`$ is the least $`i\ge1`$ with $`d\mid M+i`$ (so $`i_d(M)`$ depends only on $`M \bmod d`$), $`m_d := \#\{1\le i\le L: d\mid M+i\}`$, and terms with $`i_d(M)>L`$ are empty. In particular, for every integer $`D\ge M+L`$,
``` math
\Theta_L(M)\ =\ \sum_{d=2}^{D}\ \sum_{i=1}^{L} 2^{-i}\,\mathbf 1_{d\mid M+i},
```
and the right-hand side, with an arbitrary integer $`x\ge0`$ in place of $`M`$, depends on $`x`$ only through its residues modulo the integers $`d`$ with $`2\le d\le D`$. The cutoff $`D`$ has to be fixed before the argument varies: at $`(M,L)=(1,1)`$ the cutoff is $`M+L=2`$, the integers $`1`$ and $`3`$ have the same residue modulo every $`d`$ with $`2\le d\le 2`$, and yet $`\Theta_1(1)=1/2`$ while $`\Theta_1(3)=1`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* $`\tau(n)-1=\sum_{d\ge2}[\,d\mid n\,]`$; exchange the order of summation and sum the geometric progression $`i_d, i_d+d, i_d+2d,\dots`$ inside $`[1,L]`$. No $`d>M+L`$ divides any $`M+i`$ with $`1\le i\le L`$, which gives the cutoff form, and each indicator $`\mathbf 1_{d\mid x+i}`$ depends only on $`x \bmod d`$. ◻

</div>

The identity was also checked by exact rational computation at $`(M,L)\in\{1000,10001,123456\}\times\{12,20\}`$.

A finite divisor cutoff makes the averaging question precise. For integers $`D\ge2`$ and $`L\ge1`$, define
``` math
\Psi_{L,D}(x)=\sum_{d=2}^{D}\sum_{i=1}^{L}2^{-i}
                  \mathbf1_{d\mid x+i},\qquad
 Q_D=\operatorname{lcm}(1,\ldots,D).
```
This is the cutoff sum of Lemma <a href="#lem:odometer" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:odometer">272</a>. It is periodic in $`x`$ with period $`Q_D`$, and $`\Theta_L(M)=\Psi_{L,D}(M)`$ whenever $`M\ge1`$ and $`D\ge M+L`$. Averaging each indicator over a complete period gives
``` math
\frac1{Q_D}\sum_{x=0}^{Q_D-1}\Psi_{L,D}(x)
   =(1-2^{-L})\sum_{d=2}^{D}\frac1d.
```
The mean diverges as $`D\to\infty`$, even for fixed $`L`$. Thus this family does not converge to a finite integrable observable whose limiting mean could simply be used in an equidistribution argument.

The same issue arises if one uses the profinite integers $`\widehat{\mathbb Z}`$, whose Haar probability measure is uniform on each finite residue quotient. The finite-cutoff functions are continuous there. Their increasing limit is infinite almost everywhere: the events $`p\mid x+1`$ are independent over primes by the Chinese remainder theorem, have probabilities $`1/p`$, and occur infinitely often almost surely. Each contributes $`1/2`$ to the term at offset $`1`$. The positive integer inputs $`M`$, for which $`\Theta_L(M)`$ is finite, do not justify treating this divergent limit as a continuous or integrable function. Only the finite period average above is used in the present argument.

There is a related residue expression in Theorem <a href="#thm:real-form" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:real-form">39</a>, but its index and divisor set differ:
``` math
\sum_{d\in D_n}\left\{\frac{4^n}{2^d-1}\right\}
 =\sum_{d\in D_n}\frac{2^{-i_d(2n)}}{1-2^{-d}}.
```
Indeed $`i_d(2n)=d-(2n\bmod d)`$, with value $`d`$ when the remainder is zero. The argument is $`2n`$, not $`n`$, because the quotient scale is $`4^n=2^{2n}`$. For example, at $`n=7,d=3`$ the fractional part is $`4/7`$; using $`i_3(7)`$ would instead give $`2/7`$. This sum uses the selected finite set $`D_n`$, whereas $`\Theta_L`$ uses all divisors with offsets truncated at $`L`$. Their common geometric summand does not make the two sums equal.

To keep the changing support visible, put $`S_n=\sum_{d\in\mathrm{Skip}_n}\lfloor4^n/(2^d-1)\rfloor`$. The master identity $`\Delta_n=K(2n)+S_n`$ and the recurrence for $`K`$ give, for $`n\ge6`$ and $`\ell\ge1`$,
``` math
2^{-2\ell}\Delta_{n+\ell}
 =\Delta_n-\Theta_{2\ell}(2n)
       +2^{-2\ell}S_{n+\ell}-S_n.
```
A phase estimate would have to control this additional term and identify the required reset rows before implying the reset bound. No such implication is proved here. The scales also differ from a logarithmic-window assertion: $`\ell`$ quotient transitions use $`2\ell`$ binary steps starting at $`M=2n`$. If $`\ell`$ is proportional to $`n`$, the phase length is comparable to $`M`$, not to $`\log M`$. A theorem for logarithmic windows would need a separate argument connecting its range to the reset condition.

Finite residue expansions, divisor-sum estimates and probabilistic local estimates are possible sources of further information. None is an input already supplied here. An application must state the divisor cutoff, offset length, error at the required precision, and control on the changing skip-set sum, rather than appeal to the name of a method or to equidistribution of a different statistic.

<a id="the-specific-obstacle"></a>

##### The specific obstacle

**What the cited short-interval theorems control.** Matomäki and Radziwiłł prove that a real-valued multiplicative function bounded by $`1`$ has, in almost all windows $`[x,x+h]`$ with $`h\to\infty`$, essentially its long average \[matomakiradziwill, Theorem 1, pp. 1–2\]. Mangerel extends such bounds to a class of divisor-bounded multiplicative functions \[mangerel2021, Theorem 1.7, p. 7, and Corollary 1.8, pp. 7–8\], and Sun describes the almost-all transition profile of the $`k`$-fold divisor function at its critical polylogarithmic window \[sun2026, Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.2, p. 3\]. These results control short-interval averages. They do not by themselves supply a reset-deviation estimate or its unproved weighted-phase substitute, for two reasons.

First, their conclusions hold for almost all $`x`$, whereas the proposed application needs every reset row beyond its threshold. An exceptional set of density zero may still contain infinitely many required indices. No density assertion about the reset set, or avoidance of the exceptional set by that orbit, is proved here.

Second, $`\tau`$ is not bounded by $`1`$, and the relevant statistic is the distance to $`\mathbb{Z}`$ of a *dyadically weighted* sum of $`\tau`$-values at a precision shrinking exponentially in the window parameter. The first term $`(\tau(M+1)-1)/2`$ has fixed weight $`1/2`$, independent of the window length; an unweighted average over that window does not by itself control this term. An application through the phase would need both an exceptional-set argument along the specified indices and control of the weighted sum. It would still have to justify the passage from that sum to the reset deviation, including the skip-set correction.

**The required statistic is different.** A central limit theorem for prime-factor counts, or an almost-all theorem for unweighted interval averages, is not by itself a bound for the distance to an integer of this dyadically weighted divisor sum. An application must state its precision, its dependence on the growing window length, and its exceptional set. The references cited above do not supply that orbitwise estimate in the form used here. This is a limitation of the proposed application, not a survey claim that every relevant local estimate is unavailable.

The countermodels in the record impose similarly specific limitations.

They do not partition all possible proof methods. Together with the denominator estimate, they explain why the particular shortcuts examined here are insufficient; they do not prove that a weighted-window method is necessary or impossible.

##### Possible estimates to prove

*A conditional bound along a right-branch run.*

Let $`r\ge6`$, $`L\ge1`$, and suppose that the transitions at rows $`r,\ldots,r+L-1`$ all take the right branch. Put $`w_s=\mathrm{rem}(s)-2^s`$ and let $`p_s`$ be the lower-prefix pulse, so $`0\le p_s\le2(s-2)`$. Iterating the exact recurrence $`w_{s+1}=4w_s-4-p_s`$ gives
``` math
w_{r+L}=4^Lw_r-
       \sum_{j=0}^{L-1}4^{L-1-j}(4+p_{r+j}).
```
The reverse triangle inequality and the finite geometric sum give
``` math
|w_{r+L}|
 \ge4^L\left(|w_r|-\frac{4+2(r+L)}3\right).
```
This estimate alone does not force a right-branch run to end. For that conclusion one also needs an upper bound on its terminal deviation. More precisely, if $`C>0`$ and
``` math
|w_{r+L}|\le C2^{r+L},\qquad
 |w_r|>\frac{4+2(r+L)}3,
```
then division by $`4^L`$ and taking logarithms give
``` math
L\le r+\log_2 C-
 \log_2\left(|w_r|-\frac{4+2(r+L)}3\right).
```
Every term and hypothesis is explicit here. A separate window estimate must supply the displayed terminal upper bound; it does not follow from the right-branch recurrence alone. This explains the possible connection between the initial deviation and the run length without asserting a sharp threshold, a run-length equivalence, or an unproved bound for all later rows. This conditional calculation is an ordinary argument.

*An exact finite phase experiment.*

For the $`200{,}000`$ integers $`10^6\le M<1.2\times10^6`$, an integer divisor sieve through $`1{,}200{,}039`$ computes $`2^{40}\Theta_{40}(M)`$ exactly. Reducing that integer modulo $`2^{40}`$ gives the following counts and empirical proportions for $`\operatorname{dist}(\Theta_{40}(M),\mathbb Z)<t`$.

<div class="center">

| $`t`$ | $`2^{-6}`$ | $`2^{-8}`$ | $`2^{-10}`$ | $`2^{-12}`$ | $`2^{-14}`$ |
|:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Count | $`7083`$ | $`1858`$ | $`491`$ | $`125`$ | $`37`$ |
| Proportion | $`0.035415`$ | $`0.009290`$ | $`0.002455`$ | $`0.000625`$ | $`0.000185`$ |
| Proportion$`/t`$ | $`2.267`$ | $`2.378`$ | $`2.514`$ | $`2.560`$ | $`3.031`$ |

</div>

These counts were reproduced for this record; the experiment samples consecutive integers, not reset rows. Its median distance is $`0.24470815549\ldots`$, compared with $`1/4`$ for a uniform fractional part. A uniform fractional part has probability $`2t`$ of distance less than $`t`$, for $`0<t\le1/2`$, which explains the comparison in the last row. Agreement of a finite histogram with that model is not a distribution theorem.

Truncation matters at the smallest tested thresholds. With the same starting indices, the counts below $`2^{-14}`$ are $`22,36,37,37`$ for $`L=16,24,32,40`$, respectively. Thus similar central quantiles do not justify ignoring the truncation error in a rare-event test. More generally, for $`L'\ge L\ge1`$ and $`B\ge0`$, if $`\tau(M+i)-1\le B`$ over $`L<i\le L'`$, then
``` math
0\le\Theta_{L'}(M)-\Theta_L(M)
 \le B(2^{-L}-2^{-L'})\le B2^{-L}.
```
Distance to the nearest integer is $`1`$-Lipschitz. A threshold comparison is therefore guaranteed to remain unchanged when the distance at the shorter cutoff is farther than this error from the threshold. This is a sufficient stability test, not a necessary one. The estimate uses a bound over the specified finite range, not an unproved uniform bound on the divisor function.

A probabilistic application requires further assumptions. For example, if events $`E_r`$ in a specified probability space satisfied $`\mathbb P(E_r)\le C2^{(3-r)/2}`$ for every $`r\ge R`$, the union bound would give
``` math
\mathbb P\left(\bigcup_{r\ge R}E_r\right)
 \le \frac{C2^{(3-R)/2}}{1-2^{-1/2}}.
```
Summability would also imply only finitely many failures almost surely, not zero failures at every index. Neither the finite histogram nor its fit to a uniform-phase model proves these probability bounds, identifies their events with reset failures, or defines a probability for the actual deterministic orbit. In particular, no membership conclusion is drawn from the fitted small expected counts reported in the earlier record. The counts are exact finite computations; the error and probability inequalities are ordinary arguments; an application to resets is unproved.

*The reset signs and the exact branch identities.* Write $`p_s`$ for the nonnegative lower-prefix pulse and $`w_s=\mathrm{rem}(s)-2^s`$. On a middle transition, where the upper carry does not occur, the update is
``` math
\mathrm{rem}(s+1)=4\mathrm{rem}(s)+2^{s+1}-p_s,
 \qquad
 w_{s+1}=4w_s+2^{s+2}-p_s=4\mathrm{rem}(s)-p_s.
```
The natural-number subtraction can be read as signed subtraction because $`p_s\le2(s-2)<2^{s+1}`$ for $`s\ge5`$. The middle-branch condition is $`4\mathrm{rem}(s)<2^{s+1}+4+p_s`$, together with failure of the upper carry. Thus a positive middle-reset deviation is exactly the additional inequality $`4\mathrm{rem}(s)>p_s`$. The pulse bound and branch inequality alone do not prove it: $`s=5`$, $`\mathrm{rem}=1`$, $`p=5`$ satisfy both numerical bounds but give $`4\mathrm{rem}-p=-1`$. This is a counterexample to those numerical premises, not a claim that the concrete orbit reaches that state.

On an upper transition, let $`o_s>0`$ be the overshoot and $`p_s^+\ge0`$ the upper-prefix pulse. The carry condition pays the subtraction, so
``` math
w_{s+1}=-(4o_s+p_s^+)<0.
```
This sign already follows from the exact upper-branch identity; only the middle sign needs further orbit information. On a right transition the corresponding formula is $`w_{s+1}=4w_s-4-p_s`$. The same middle and upper deviation identities appear in a [Lean source](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos-lean/blob/52f29ad173b04e3bac941b3663f2b9aebe5de0bb/Erdos257PeriodNoncollapse/HalfResetSqrtEscapeScaleProducers.lean#L79-L144), which was not recompiled for this record. They separate the sign calculation from the unproved magnitude estimate needed for square-root escape. At the reported middle step $`s=14`$, for example, $`\mathrm{rem}(14)=392`$, $`p_{14}=3`$ and $`\mathrm{rem}(15)=34333`$, giving $`w_{15}=1565`$.

#### Progress to larger endpoint depths

<a id="the-statement-needed-1"></a>

##### The statement needed

The exact-row transition [`exactLocalMersenneHalfRow_double_or_recycle`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusExactRowDichotomy.lean#L26) says every exact row $`n\ge6`$ either doubles to $`2n-1`$ or recycles to $`2c-2`$ for some $`4\le c\le n`$. Exact rows at unbounded depths, which give $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$, need the recycle branch not to return to a bounded endpoint forever. Three sufficient forms:
``` math
\text{(a)}\quad
\text{critical quotient supply}:\ \forall D\subseteq[2,c),\ 4\le c,\
v(D)<\tfrac12\ \wedge\ \tfrac12-v(D)<\ensuremath{w}\,c
```
``` math
\Longrightarrow\quad 2^{\,(2c-2)-1}\ \le\ \ensuremath{Q}\,(\{c\}\cup D)\,(2c-2),
```
where $`v(D):=\ensuremath{V}\ D`$ ([`SkippedCoreCriticalQuotientSupply`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusCriticalCapacityCofinal.lean#L30));
``` math
\text{(b)}\quad
\text{the crossing rank } c \text{ produced by the recycle branch does not repeat a bounded value infinitely often};
```
``` math
\text{(c)}\quad
c\ge g(n),\qquad 2g(n)-2>n
\quad\text{at every reachable recycle input }n.
```

Unboundedness of $`g`$ alone would not suffice in (c). For example, $`g(n)=\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1`$ tends to infinity but allows the fixed transition $`n=6`$, $`c=4`$, $`2c-2=6`$. The displayed strict-progress inequality excludes such cycles; the doubling branch already increases every endpoint $`n\ge6`$.

<a id="what-kind-of-object-would-furnish-it"></a>

##### What kind of object would furnish it

The real and integer greedy rules must be distinguished here. A real straddling word agrees with the real greedy prefix ([`IsStraddlePrefix.half_agrees_greedy`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCutLocator.lean#L442)). An exact local row instead satisfies $`\ensuremath{Q}\ D\ n=2^{n-1}-1`$. Although floor division is not injective in general, the quotient weights at fixed $`n`$ have a gap of at least $`1`$ between distinct subset sums. A witness is therefore unique when it exists and is recovered by the integer greedy test (Theorem <a href="#record:257bm-i11a" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i11a">143</a> and Propositions <a href="#record:257bm-i11b" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i11b">144</a>–<a href="#record:257bm-i11c" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-i11c">145</a>). There is no exponential family of witnesses to choose from at that depth. What remains to prove is that successful depths are unbounded.

One possible additional ingredient is an integer-valued function $`\Phi(n,D)\ge0`$ on reachable exact rows that increases by at least one under each permitted transition and is bounded on rows of bounded endpoint. Along an infinite trajectory, $`\Phi`$ would then tend to infinity, forcing the endpoints to be unbounded. Strict increase only on recycle steps would need a separate check of what doubling does to $`\Phi`$; an unspecified real-valued increasing quantity need not tend to infinity. This describes one possible proof mechanism, not a necessary class of all proofs. The record already has the sharp capacity test in exact form: by [`localBinarySuffix_two_mul_sub_two_lt_criticalCapacity_iff`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusSkippedCoreCriticalCapacity.lean#L22), form (a) is exactly the statement that the $`c-2`$-bit suffix capacity $`\ensuremath{S}\,D\,1\,(2c-2)<2^{\,c-2}`$ is met.

<a id="the-specific-obstacle-1"></a>

##### The specific obstacle

The formal counterexample concerns exactly the transition schema: that schema *plus* a seed provably does not give cofinality. The theorem [`exists_seeded_bounded_double_or_recycle_model`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusExactRowDichotomy.lean#L91) exhibits the one-point predicate $`P(n):=(n=6)`$, which satisfies the seed ([`exactLocalMersenneHalfRow_six`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusExactRowSeed.lean#L34), the explicit witness $`\{2,3,6\}`$) and the exact shape of the transition, and is not cofinal. So no argument that uses only the dichotomy and the base case can work, however cleverly the induction is arranged. Any proof must use arithmetic content of exact rows that the abstract schema does not see.

There is a second, more specific trap, and it is also formalised. The natural sufficient condition via fractional split mass is *not necessary*: the example at $`D=\{2,3\}`$, $`c=5`$ ([`splitFractionMass_one_bound_not_necessary_fixture`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusSkippedCoreCriticalCapacity.lean#L183)) exhibits a real crossing core violating it. Thus the fractional-mass bound is not necessary for an individual crossing core. This counterexample does not rule out proving that sufficient bound on a more restricted family.

<a id="possible-estimates-to-prove-1"></a>

##### Possible estimates to prove

*The uniquely determined prefix at a crossing.* The identification below is proved; the required capacity bound remains open.

Form (a) is universally quantified over cores $`D`$, which looks like an exponential obligation. It is not. Its hypotheses are exactly those of [`eq_halfGreedyPrefixSupport_of_critical_crossing`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusCriticalCapacityCofinal.lean#L50), which forces $`D=G\cap\{1,\ldots,c-1\}`$. So the $`\forall D`$ collapses to a single orbit and form (a) is a statement to be checked along *one* sequence indexed by $`c`$, namely
``` math
\forall c\ge4\ \text{skipped by the real half-greedy orbit}:\qquad
\ensuremath{S}\bigl(G\cap\{1,\ldots,c-1\},\,1,\,2c-2\bigr)\ <\ 2^{\,c-2}.
```
The crossing hypothesis has not disappeared: these are the ranks where the real greedy rule skips the next term. Each resulting finite inequality is decidable. Computing its margin can identify examples to explain a proposed estimate, but a finite table neither selects a proof method nor establishes a cofinal supply.

The progress-function criterion above remains unproved. Endpoint doubling is not a proved doubling law for the largest selected exponent, and an unbounded function of the incoming endpoint alone does not rule out a bounded cycle.

<a id="sec:invent-R3"></a>

#### Prime support and the limits of one formal argument

The base-$`2`$ statement
``` math
\mathrm{Irrational}\Bigl(\sum_{p\ {\rm prime}}\frac1{2^p-1}\Bigr)
```
is known. Expanding geometrically and collecting divisors gives
``` math
\sum_{p\ {\rm prime}}\frac1{2^p-1}
 =\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\omega(n)}{2^n},
```
and Tao–Teräväinen prove the latter series irrational in Theorem 1.3 of [*Quantitative correlations and some problems on prime factors of consecutive integers*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01739). This is a cited analytic result, not a theorem formalised in Lean.

The existing pairwise-coprime Lean theorem does not recover it because that theorem assumes $`\sum_{a\in A}1/a<\infty`$, whereas $`\sum_p1/p`$ diverges. The block-certificate criterion behind it would also demand, in the prime case,
``` math
2^r\mid\omega(N+r)\qquad(1\le r\le K),
```
a simultaneous exact divisibility pattern far stronger than the input used by Tao–Teräväinen. Small computational witnesses for $`K=2,3`$ diagnose that the condition is not vacuous, but they neither prove the known theorem nor define a new open case.

Thus the contribution of this analysis is negative and specific to the method: it identifies why the present formal certificate criterion fails to reproduce a theorem already available by quantitative correlation estimates. The earlier proposal to prove the prime-support irrationality as new mathematics is withdrawn. Extensions to other bases or prime-power supports are mentioned by the cited authors with proof modifications omitted; this paper promotes only the fully written base-$`2`$ theorem.

#### Equivalent carry conditions at perfect-square depths

<a id="the-statement-needed-2"></a>

##### The statement needed

The following five conditions are equivalent to $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$:

1.  $`C_G(N)\le2\sqrt N+4`$ for every $`N\ge0`$.

2.  The set $`\mathbb N_{>0}\smallsetminus G`$ is infinite.

3.  For arbitrarily large $`n`$ there is $`D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,n\}`$ with $`Q(D,n)=2^{n-1}-1`$.

4.  For arbitrarily large $`M`$, $`\operatorname{ihc}(G,M)\le B(M+1)`$.

5.  For arbitrarily large $`M\ge1`$ there is $`D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,M\}`$ with $`|\operatorname{ihc}(D,M-1)|\le B(M)`$.

Here $`G`$ is the actual greedy support for $`1/2`$. The forward directions of (2)–(5) are proved in Lean ([`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_positiveHalfGreedySkips`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusSkipRowCofinal.lean#L97), [`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_cofinalExactLocalRows`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusCofinalExactRows.lean#L71), [`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_cofinalStripReturn`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CofinalStripReturn.lean#L157), [`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_cofinalTerminalOnlyStrip`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TerminalOnlyCofinal.lean#L134)). The reverse implications are ordinary deductions in this paper. The perfect-square argument below supplies the terminal bounds without changing the constant in the original statements.

The difference between the real and the integer square root disappears when cofinal witness depths are restricted to perfect squares: at $`n=k^{2}`$ the two roots coincide exactly and no widening is needed.

<a id="what-the-equivalences-establish"></a>

##### What the equivalences establish

Each biconditional is a theorem about the exact logical content of a proposed hypothesis. It is also a reformulation of the membership question. These are compatible descriptions, not competing evidence classes. The equivalence identifies the missing content but does not show that the reformulation cannot expose a useful invariant. In particular, (3) shows that the existence of finite witnesses at unbounded depths, even without compatibility between those witnesses, is equivalent to membership. The absence of a compatibility requirement may still be useful in constructing witnesses; equivalence alone says nothing about which formulation is easier to prove.

**Scope of the equivalences.** (1) does *not* extend to every $`A`$ with $`1\notin A`$: without [`erdosSupportSeries_greedyMersenneSupport_le`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCarryReachability.lean#L888) (which supplies $`\delta:=1/2-S_G\ge0`$ for the greedy support specifically) one obtains only the one-sided equivalence of the bound in (1), with $`A`$ in place of $`G`$, and $`1/2-S_A\le0`$. The mechanism in all five cases is the same and should be recorded once: $`2^{\,N+1}\delta`$ dominates any $`\sqrt{N}`$ envelope, so a strip hypothesis forces $`\delta=0`$; and $`\delta=0`$ makes the unconditional tail bound supply the strip. Membership is then read off by [`mem_mersenneAchievementSet_iff_greedy_survival`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean#L1458).

#### Sparse and dense supports under the certificate criterion

<a id="the-statement-needed-3"></a>

##### The statement needed

``` math
\begin{gathered}
 A\subseteq\mathbb N_{>0},\quad A\text{ infinite}\quad\Longrightarrow\\
 \text{$c_A$ has arbitrarily late super-logarithmic zero windows}\\
 \text{or the specified block certificates exist at every precision.}
 \end{gathered}
```
For a fixed nonempty $`A`$, let $`a_0=\min A`$. Every interval of $`a_0`$ consecutive integers contains a multiple of $`a_0`$, so $`c_A`$ has no zero window longer than $`a_0-1`$. The first alternative is therefore impossible, independently of rationality. The cited logarithmic result [`supportCoeffZeroWindow_length_le_eps_logb`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/SublogDivisorCoverage.lean#L435) does not create a sparse subclass here. The separate lcm-gap theorem [`irrational_erdosSum_of_lcm_gap`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean#L5883) remains a valid sufficient criterion, but does not prove this proposed alternative. The proposal would consequently require the following certificates for every infinite support:
``` math
\exists N,K,L,C,\quad K\le L,\quad
\forall r\in[1,K]:\ 2^{r}\mid c_{A}(N+r),
```
``` math
\sum_{r=K+1}^{L}c_{A}(N+r)\,2^{\,L-r}\le C,
\qquad
q\,(C+N+L+2)<2^{L}.
```

<a id="what-kind-of-object-would-furnish-it-1"></a>

##### What kind of object would furnish it

The identity $`c_A=\mathbf1_A*\mathbf1`$ is a Dirichlet convolution, and Möbius inversion gives $`\mathbf1_A=\mu*c_A`$. These identities hold for every support, but do not supply the displayed divisibility or tail estimates. Shared factors restrict which residue prescriptions can be realised; they do not make the Chinese remainder theorem inapplicable. For positive moduli $`m_i`$, a finite system $`N\equiv a_i\pmod{m_i}`$ is solvable precisely when
``` math
a_i\equiv a_j\pmod{\gcd(m_i,m_j)}\qquad\text{for every }i,j.
```
Necessity follows by subtraction. For sufficiency, keep the strongest prime-power modulus for each prime; compatibility makes all weaker prescriptions agree with it, and the ordinary CRT combines the resulting coprime prime powers \[conradcrt, Theorem 3.1, pp. 2–3\]. For example, $`N\equiv1\pmod4`$ and $`N\equiv1\pmod6`$ give $`N\equiv1\pmod{12}`$, whereas $`4\mid N`$ and $`2\nmid N`$ are incompatible. A block-certificate construction must satisfy these compatibility conditions and its separate tail budget. Neither Möbius inversion nor CRT alone provides both inputs.

<a id="the-specific-obstacle-proved"></a>

##### The specific obstacle, proved

The dense branch as stated is *false*: an explicit, natural, divisor-dense support refutes it. This also corrects an earlier claim that universal \#257 reduces with no loss to the existence of certificates for every infinite support.

**Proposition 274** (Squarefree support: a limit of the certificate method, not an open value). *Let $`A=\{n\ge2:n\text{ is squarefree}\}`$. Then
``` math
c_{A}(n)=2^{\omega(n)}-1,
```
which is odd for every $`n\ge2`$. Consequently neither the digitwise nor the carry-aware divisibility-first block-certificate schema has an instance at any even base.*

</div>

This does not leave the squarefree value open. Duverney–Tachiya’s Corollary 1.2 and Example 1.1 prove that, for every $`h\ge1`$,
``` math
1,\quad
  \sum_{n\ {\rm squarefree}}\frac1{2^n-1},\quad\ldots,\quad
  \sum_{n\ {\rm squarefree}}\frac1{2^{hn}-1}
```
are linearly independent over $`\mathbb{Q}`$. After deleting the rational $`n=1`$ term, squarefree support is therefore irrational at every base $`2^j`$. Among the integer bases, the cited theorem leaves the non-powers of two uncovered. This is cited mathematics, not formalised here. Proposition <a href="#prop:squarefree" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:squarefree">274</a> is a failure of two proof schemas on a value already known to be irrational.

The dependence on the choice of support is exact. Adjoin $`1`$ to the support. The series changes by the rational number $`(b-1)^{-1}`$, so its irrationality is unchanged, while the incidence becomes $`2^{\omega(n)}`$: [`ErdosProblems.Erdos257.SquarefreeSupportIncidence.supportCoeff_squarefreeShiftedSupport`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/SquarefreeSupportIncidence.lean#L314) and [`ErdosProblems.Erdos257.SquarefreeSupportIncidence.irrational_erdosSupportSeries_squarefreeSupport_iff_shifted`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/SquarefreeSupportIncidence.lean#L335). At base $`2`$, CRT then supplies arbitrarily long opening blocks with $`\omega(N+r)\ge r`$: [`ErdosProblems.Erdos257.SquarefreeSupportIncidence.exists_omega_ge_block`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/SquarefreeSupportIncidence.lean#L441) and [`ErdosProblems.Erdos257.SquarefreeSupportIncidence.exists_digitwise_block_squarefreeShiftedSupport`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/SquarefreeSupportIncidence.lean#L485). The middle-window and height conditions remain; no certificate or new irrationality proof follows. The durable conclusion is methodological: test a no-go statement under rational finite changes before attributing it to the underlying value.

#### What the experiments and obstructions do not imply

Everything in this subsection is inference from the recorded failures, not a theorem. Where the evidence does not determine the answer, the text says so.

<a id="finite-observations-and-their-limits"></a>

##### Finite observations and their limits

The recorded obstructions concern specified representations. Fixed precision, a bounded carry state and a prescribed suffix can lose information needed by the actual-selector condition. They do not show that the underlying deterministic sequence has no arithmetic structure. The relevant exact statements remain [`fixedPrecisionTropicalNoGo`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TropicalCurvatureCarry.lean#L137), [`balancedPulse_no_autonomous_decoder`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GenericTailOrbitRigidity.lean#L247) and [`affineBinaryOrbit_mod_twoPow_eq`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GenericTailOrbitRigidity.lean#L307). Their hypotheses, rather than the fact that an attempted argument failed, determine their scope.

The inherited experiment log reports $`200{,}000`$ seam rows with counts $`R:M:U=100197:49899:49898`$, which a [saved run](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f757115e03bebe5c04431a147da559015c680a37/research/experiments/erdos257/receipts/seam-orbit-200000.json) reproduces, a roughly geometric run-length histogram, and a longest equal run of $`15`$ in $`40{,}000`$ binary digits. It also reports agreement with OEIS A211706 and a near-integer phase constant of about $`2.5`$. The other figures and the external digit comparison come from that log alone. They are descriptive reports, not certificates of normality, independence, a random sampling model, or an infinite anti-concentration estimate. A statement about “sampling noise” would require a specified probabilistic model that is not supplied here.

The previously reported exceptional row $`r=7`$ and crossing $`(s,d)=(10,7)`$ are likewise statements about the tested range only. The exact range and reproduction artefacts must accompany them before they are used as numerical evidence outside this historical record. No claim that this is the only exceptional row of the infinite orbit is made.

These representations all descend from the same greedy carry; they are not independent tests of a common random hypothesis. Strict tail domination gives an injective coding, but says neither that its digits are random nor that averaging over indices is impossible. The measure-one and nowhere-dense properties of the achievement set do not decide membership of a specified rational. The correct research question is whether a precise arithmetic estimate can be proved for the actual selector, not whether finite data resemble a random model.

<a id="why-the-support-and-rational-target-problems-remain-distinct"></a>

##### Why the support and rational-target problems remain distinct

Proposition <a href="#prop:squarefree" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:squarefree">274</a> is a reason to separate the two halves rather than assimilate them. On the universal side the present certificate method first meets a parity obstruction that depends on the choice of support. The squarefree value is nevertheless already known to be irrational at power-of-two bases, and adjoining $`1`$ removes the opening-block obstruction without changing irrationality. Thus the obstruction concerns this method; it does not concern the value or the universal problem.

Short-window near-integer anti-concentration is one possible missing input for the particular mechanisms analysed here. No equivalence shows that it is necessary for either problem, and no argument identifies it as a common necessary obstruction to both. The squarefree example shows why finite rational changes of support must be checked before an opening-block failure is interpreted as a property of the value.

<a id="what-the-evidence-does-and-does-not-determine"></a>

##### What the evidence does and does not determine

It does not determine whether a short proof exists: nothing in a catalogue of failed methods bounds the length of a successful one.

It records limitations of specified methods. The fixed-precision completion theorem and the balanced-pulse countermodel concern the particular summaries defined above, not all fixed-precision arithmetic or all finite-state methods with additional arithmetic input. An irrationality-measure bound on $`E`$ does not classify a specified rational in $`\mathcal{A}`$. Instantiating the present block-certificate method at a general support is blocked, on the universal side, by Proposition <a href="#prop:squarefree" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:squarefree">274</a>. Survival through any tested finite depth does not by itself establish membership; a fatal-gap certificate would establish non-membership. These facts do not decide rational-target membership, and they do not yield an impossibility theorem for all probabilistic, measure-theoretic or averaging methods. Each recorded obstruction, unlike a failed attempt, can be reused; that is what this part contributes.

### What is open, stated exactly

Erdős \#257 asks whether $`\sum_{n\in A}1/(2^n-1)`$ is irrational for *every* infinite $`A\subseteq\mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}`$. Nothing in this paper decides this, in either the universal form or the single-target half-value form below. Parts I–IV do prove unconditional theorems for specified support classes, as well as uniform finite-denominator and achievement-set results. The unresolved membership conditions must be distinguished from those results: some are equivalences, some are unproved sufficient conditions, and some have only finite computational checks. This section states the exact open targets, their Lean sources where formalised, and their logical relationships. The implication table in §<a href="#sec:v-table" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:v-table">12.8</a> shows that several apparent intermediate steps are *equivalent* to the full problem.

<a id="notation-fixed-for-this-section"></a>

#### Notation fixed for this section

The base-$`2`$ support series is $`X_{A}(2) := \sum_{n\in A} 1/(2^n-1)`$ ([`erdosSupportSeries`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean#L8897)). $`c_{A}(n) :=
|\{d\mid n : d\in A\}|`$ ([`supportCoeff`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean#L8856)) is the divisor-indicator coefficient whose generating tail enters every certificate below. $`\mathcal{A}=\{X_A(2):A\subseteq\mathbb N_{\ge1}\}`$ ([`mersenneAchievementSet`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean#L571)). $`G`$ is the greedy support for target $`1/2`$; $`\mathrm{rem}(s)`$ is its integer seam remainder at row $`s`$, and a *reset* at row $`r`$ is a row where the greedy orbit returns to the near-$`2^r`$ regime after a run of takes or skips.

<a id="the-universal-statement"></a>

#### The universal statement

<div class="defn">

**Definition 275** (Universal \#257).
``` math
\mathrm{U257} \;:=\; \forall\, A\subseteq\mathbb{N}_{\ge 1},\ A\text{ infinite} \;\Longrightarrow\;
\mathrm{Irrational}\!\left(X_{A}(2)\right).
```

</div>

This is the literal statement of Erdős \#257; it is open. The sufficient condition used by the certificate method of this record is
``` math
\mathrm{Cert}(A)\ :=\ \forall q>0,\ \exists N,K,L,C,\ K\le L,\
\left(\forall r\in[1,K],\ 2^r\mid c_{A}(N+r)\right)\wedge{}
```
``` math
\sum_{r=K+1}^{L}c_{A}(N+r)\cdot 2^{L-r}\le C\ \wedge\
\exists t,\ 0<c_{A}(N+L+1+t)\ \wedge\ q(C+N+L+2)<2^L,
```
with $`\mathrm{Cert}(A)\Rightarrow \mathrm{Irrational}(X_{A}(2))`$ already proved unconditionally for *every* $`A`$ ([`irrational_erdosSupportSeries_of_weighted_coeff_certificates`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean#L9031); the theorem is universally quantified over $`A`$, and only its hypothesis is missing). Therefore the stronger statement
``` math
\mathrm{O1'}\ :=\ \forall A,\ A\text{ infinite}\Longrightarrow \mathrm{Cert}(A).
```
would imply $`\mathrm{U257}`$, but the reduction is *not* lossless and $`\mathrm{O1'}`$ is actually false. For $`A=\{n\ge2:n\text{ squarefree}\}`$ the incidence is $`2^{\omega(n)}-1`$, hence odd for every $`n\ge2`$, and the digitwise certificate schema has no instance at any even base ([`ErdosProblems.Erdos257.SquarefreeSupportIncidence.not_exists_digitwise_certificates_squarefreeSupport`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/SquarefreeSupportIncidence.lean#L292)). This is a limit of the method, not a counterexample to irrationality: Duverney–Tachiya prove the squarefree value irrational at every power-of-two base. Likewise the pairwise-coprime theorem does not cover the primes because $`\sum_p1/p`$ diverges, even though Tao–Teräväinen prove the base-$`2`$ prime-support value irrational. The universal target is $`\mathrm{U257}`$ itself; $`\mathrm{O1'}`$ is a rejected sufficient strengthening, not an open equivalent normal form.

<a id="whether-one-half-is-represented"></a>

#### Whether one half is represented

<div class="defn">

**Definition 276** (Half membership).
``` math
\mathrm{HALF}\ :=\ \tfrac12\in\mathcal{A}.
```

</div>

$`\mathrm{HALF}`$ is a *single instance* of the negation of $`\mathrm{U257}`$: any witness $`A`$ with $`0\notin A`$, $`X_{A}(2)=1/2`$ is infinite ([`finite_boolSupport_ne_half`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCarryReachability.lean#L589); finite supports have odd-denominator value, so can never equal a dyadic rational), hence a genuine counterexample to $`\mathrm{U257}`$. Thus $`\mathrm{HALF}\Rightarrow\neg\mathrm{U257}`$. The reverse implication is not established: failure of half-membership would not decide $`\mathrm{U257}`$ if false, since $`\mathrm{U257}`$ could still fail at a different target $`t\in\mathbb{Q}`$. $`\mathrm{HALF}`$ is open. It is logically equivalent, by an unconditional Lean theorem, to a purely combinatorial statement about one fixed orbit:
``` math
\mathrm{HALF}\ \Longleftrightarrow\ \text{the set of ranks skipped by the greedy rule for }\tfrac12\text{ is infinite}
```
([`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_iff_greedySkippedSupport_infinite`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean#L2583); the reverse direction holds for every target, and the forward direction uses only that the target is rational, so the same theorem holds verbatim for every rational $`t\ge 0`$ in place of $`1/2`$).

<a id="conditions-equivalent-to-half-membership"></a>

##### Conditions equivalent to half-membership

The following three conditions are equivalent to half-membership. They express the same unresolved assertion in different terms. The proofs of equivalence identify the content still to be established; they do not compare the difficulty of possible proofs.

<div id="prop:cpgs-equiv" class="prop">
<p class="evidence-marks"><a href="https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/c91562bd574a387cde904481e609c7b4cacebb14/lean/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/PaperCompleteR21/SquareDepthAndHalfMembershipEquivalences.lean#L44">Lean</a> · <a href="https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/c75e491ca57b70ba3a2b5a418c7acd49a53d8dfe/evidence/erdos257-mersenne-reasoning-surface/section-12.md#prop-cpgs-equiv-comparator">Comparator</a></p>

**Proposition 277** (Infinitely many positive skips are equivalent to half-membership). *Define
``` math
\mathrm{CPGS}\ :=\ \forall N,\ \exists c\ge N,\ c\ \text{skipped by the rational half-greedy
orbit}\ \wedge\ 0<\ensuremath{r}(1/2)(c-1)
```
The positivity conjunct is unconditionally true for every skipped $`c`$ (an odd-denominator parity fact), hence deletable without changing the Prop’s meaning. What survives, $`\forall N\,\exists c\ge N`$ skipped, is exactly $`(\mathtt{greedyMersenneSkippedSupport}(1/2)).\mathrm{Infinite}`$, so
``` math
\mathrm{CPGS}\ \Longleftrightarrow\ \mathrm{HALF}.
```*

</div>

The proof is an ordinary argument. The cited implication [`cofinalExactLocalMersenneHalfRows_of_positiveHalfGreedySkips`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusSkipRowCofinal.lean#L84) therefore gives an equivalent formulation, not a proof of membership.

<div id="prop:strip-equiv" class="prop">
<p class="evidence-marks"><a href="https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/c75e491ca57b70ba3a2b5a418c7acd49a53d8dfe/evidence/erdos257-mersenne-reasoning-surface/section-12.md#prop-strip-equiv">Lean</a> · <a href="https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/c75e491ca57b70ba3a2b5a418c7acd49a53d8dfe/evidence/erdos257-mersenne-reasoning-surface/section-12.md#prop-strip-equiv-comparator">Comparator</a></p>

**Proposition 278** (Terminal carry bounds are equivalent to half-membership). *Consider finite sets $`D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,M\}`$ at arbitrarily large depths $`M`$ with
``` math
|\operatorname{ihc}(D,M-1)|\le2\lfloor\sqrt M\rfloor+4.
```
This is the exact terminal-strip condition. It is equivalent to $`1/2\in\mathcal A`$: the forward direction follows from the displayed finite-approximation estimate; for the converse, truncate an achieving support at $`M=k^2`$ and apply Lemma <a href="#lem:sqrt-witness" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:sqrt-witness">17</a>. Thus constant $`4`$ already suffices at cofinally many depths. The relaxed constant $`6`$ gives a bound at every depth, using $`\sqrt M\le\lfloor\sqrt M\rfloor+1`$, but that relaxation is not needed for the cofinal statement.*

</div>

The proof is an ordinary argument. This corrects the claim that the existence condition is logically weaker. An equivalent formulation may still be useful for finding a proof.

<div class="obs">

*Observation 279*. Propositions <a href="#prop:cpgs-equiv" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:cpgs-equiv">277</a> and <a href="#prop:strip-equiv" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:strip-equiv">278</a> do not decide half-membership. They show that the proposed existence conditions are equivalent to it, not that those formulations have no possible use. The upper bound on the centred carry in [`greedy_half_infinite_of_mobiusCenteredHalfCarry_sqrtBound`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCarryReachability.lean#L834) has the same equivalence for the greedy support $`A=G`$. For arbitrary $`A`$ with $`1\notin A`$, an upper bound alone yields only $`x_A\ge1/2`$, as the identity $`\operatorname{ihc}(A,N)=2^{N+1}(1/2-x_A)+\mathrm T(N+1)`$ shows. The greedy inequality $`x_G\le1/2`$ is what turns that conclusion into equality.

#### Exact finite sums at unbounded depths

**Definition 280**. For every integer $`N`$, require some $`n\ge\max\{N,1\}`$ and $`D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,n\}`$ with
``` math
\sum_{d\in D}\left\lfloor\frac{2^n}{2^d-1}\right\rfloor
       =2^{n-1}-1.
```
([`CofinalExactLocalMersenneHalfRows`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusCofinalExactRows.lean#L38)). This condition is unproved. Supports at different depths need not agree. This is the condition in Definition <a href="#record:257bm-d4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="record:257bm-d4">109</a>; no strict weakening of half-membership is asserted.

</div>

The implication from this condition to $`\mathrm{HALF}`$ is proved unconditionally via compactness of $`\mathcal{A}`$ (a continuous image of the space of $`0/1`$ sequences under the digit-coding map, hence closed) ([`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_cofinalExactLocalRows`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusCofinalExactRows.lean#L71)). The cited theorem already proves that a representing support exists, because that is what membership of $`\mathcal A`$ means. It need not choose a support by a specified algorithm from the row witnesses. An ordinary diagonal subsequence argument gives a compatible limiting support: successively fix each coordinate along an infinite subsequence, then use the uniform tail bound to pass to its value. This uses continuity of the digit map, also recorded in [`continuous_positiveMersenneDigitValue`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean#L628). The diagonal argument preserves $`2\in A`$, since all sufficiently deep exact rows contain exponent two ([`two_mem_of_exact_localMersenneQuotient`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusExactRowRankTwo.lean#L23)). This describes an ordinary existence proof; no additional formal extraction theorem or effective algorithm from purely existential row data is claimed.

Proposition <a href="#prop:collapsed-list" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:collapsed-list">18</a>(c) already identifies this condition as logically equivalent to $`1/2\in\mathcal{A}`$. Equivalence of a membership condition, constructive extraction of a coherent support, and a rejected sufficient strengthening are not interchangeable descriptions. Absence of a Lean extraction theorem does not make this condition a strictly weaker substitute for $`\mathrm{HALF}`$. The remaining work here is to supply exact rows at unbounded depths, or any equivalent membership condition.

##### A capacity condition for exact sums at unbounded depths

The finite construction uses a $`(c-2)`$-bit capacity test. Write

The loose bound below requires a critical crossing: $`c\ge4`$, $`D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,c-1\}`$, and $`0<1/2-V(D)<w_c`$. A merely below-half core is not enough: $`D=\varnothing`$ gives $`S(D,1,2c-2)=2^{2c-3}-1`$. For a critical-crossing core the two bounds are

$`(\ast\ast)`$ is exactly one bit sharper and, via [`localBinarySuffix_two_mul_sub_two_lt_criticalCapacity_iff`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusSkippedCoreCriticalCapacity.lean#L22) (under the stated core hypotheses), is equivalent to $`Q(D\cup\{c\},2c-2)\ge2^{2c-3}`$. Here $`c`$ is the added exponent; the quotient is evaluated at depth $`2c-2`$, not at depth $`c`$. The proof of $`(\ast)`$ gives the more informative additive bound $`S<2^{c-2}+|D|`$ before using $`|D|\le c-2`$. One possible cofinal supply is therefore the following exclusion of a specified integer interval:
``` math
\begin{gathered}
\text{(O3-supply)}\qquad \forall N\ \exists c\ge\max(N,4)\ \exists D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,c-1\},\\
0<1/2-V(D)<w_c,\qquad
S(D,1,2c-2)\notin[\,2^{c-2},\,2^{c-2}+c-3\,].
\end{gathered}
```
The excluded band contains $`c-2`$ integers. The sharp capacity bound itself allows $`2^{c-2}`$ nonnegative integer values. The numerical widths differ from those in Section <a href="#sec:o4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:o4">12.5</a>, but the conditions concern different quantities. Width alone does not prove a logical implication between them.

The sharp-fill implication [`exists_exactRowStrictUpperFill_of_skippedCoreSharpCapacity`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusSkipRow.lean#L238) assumes $`(\ast\ast)`$ for a below-half core $`D\subseteq\{2,\ldots,c-1\}`$, but does not require a critical crossing or identify that core with a real greedy prefix. This gives another formulation in which to seek the required finite rows. It does not establish a strict logical weakening of half-membership, nor does it supply cores satisfying the bound at unbounded ranks. Moreover, the integer gap separation fixes the resulting exact row whenever it exists; the formulation does not create multiple exact rows at a fixed depth.

The complete induction from the endpoint-six seed to exact sums at unbounded depths is already formalised ([`cofinalExactLocalMersenneHalfRows_of_criticalQuotientSupply`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusCriticalCapacityCofinal.lean#L1309)); it uses the sharp capacity input, in its reduced canonical form
``` math
c\ge4,\ c\notin G\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
 Q\bigl((G\cap\{2,\ldots,c-1\})\cup\{c\},2c-2\bigr)
 \ge2^{2c-3}.
```
([`HalfGreedySkippedCriticalQuotientSupply`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/BooleanMobiusCriticalCapacityCofinal.lean#L178)), at essentially every step; this input is unproved. This condition is required along the specified greedy prefixes. That restriction on the witnesses does not by itself prove a strict logical ordering with the cofinal condition above.

#### Reset bounds and runs of right transitions

<div class="defn">

**Definition 281** (Reset $`\sqrt{\text{-escape}}`$ from row 10).
``` math
\mathrm{SQRTESC}\ :=\ \forall r\ge10\ \text{that are resets},\quad
\big|\mathrm{rem}(r+1)-2^{r+1}\big|>2^{(r+5)/2}
\qquad\Big(\text{equivalently } \Delta_{r+1}^2 > 2^{r+5}\Big).
```

</div>

The conditional implication uses the integer bound $`B(r)=2^{\lfloor(r+4)/2\rfloor}+2r+3`$ described in Theorem <a href="#thm:lower-bound-every-reset" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:lower-bound-every-reset">246</a>: $`B(r)^2\le2^{r+5}`$ for $`r\ge10`$, while a right branch at the critical crossing would force $`|\Delta_{r+1}|\le B(r)`$. Thus the actual implication chain is
``` math
\mathrm{SQRTESC}\ \Longrightarrow\
 \text{the hypothesis of Theorem~\ref{thm:largest-skip-late}}\ \Longrightarrow\ \mathrm{HALF}.
```
The last implication is [`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_largestSkipLateStepSocket`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderLargestSkipInduction.lean#L167); the first is proved in Theorem <a href="#thm:lower-bound-every-reset" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:lower-bound-every-reset">246</a>. These are sufficient implications, not an equivalence with half-membership.

For comparison one may ask for
``` math
\mathrm{RUNBOUND}:\qquad
 \forall\,\text{reset }r\ge31,\quad L_r<(r-3)/2,
```
where $`L_r`$ counts the consecutive right branches after reset $`r`$. Along $`L`$ such steps the exact relation is
``` math
w_{r+1+L}=4^Lw_{r+1}
   -\sum_{j=0}^{L-1}4^{L-1-j}(4+p_{r+1+j}).
```
The pulse sum and the threshold ranges cannot be dropped to claim $`\mathrm{RUNBOUND}\Leftrightarrow\mathrm{SQRTESC}`$. The pointwise run/deviation equivalence stated in earlier source notes is not established by the bound used in the conditional proof. The observation at $`r=7`$ (deviation $`9`$, square-root threshold $`64`$) is outside both proposed late ranges; that fact alone does not justify replacing the initial threshold $`10`$ by $`31`$.

*Finite evidence.* Exact integer arithmetic to row $`200{,}000`$ shows that the target inequality holds at every reset row $`6\le r\le200{,}000`$ except $`r=7`$; the maximum observed R-run is $`19`$, at row $`158{,}096`$, against a required threshold there of $`\approx79{,}046`$, a margin of about $`4000`$ times. This is a finite verified list; it supplies no witnesses at unbounded depths.

<div class="obs">

*Observation 282* (The sign of the reset deviation). At all $`1209`$ observed resets, the sign of the deviation is perfectly predicted by branch type (M$`\Rightarrow`$dev$`>0`$, U$`\Rightarrow`$dev$`<0`$, zero exceptions), and the margin over the threshold grows from $`1.11`$ bits at $`r=14`$ to $`\sim1246`$ bits by row $`2500`$ (exact computation). Proving the sign law reduces to the middle inequality $`4\mathrm{rem}(r)>p_r`$. For an upper reset the sign already follows from $`w_{r+1}=-(4o_r+p_r^+)<0`$, with positive overshoot and nonnegative pulse. The middle inequality remains unproved. Even after both signs are known, a separate lower bound for their magnitudes is required for $`\mathrm{SQRTESC}`$.

</div>

<div id="obs:dangerous-reset-rigidity" class="obs">

*Observation 283* (Rigidity of dangerous resets). If reset $`r`$ is *dangerous* ($`|\mathrm{rem}(r+1)-2^{r+1}|\le2^{(r+5)/2}`$) and the preceding reset $`r_0`$ has a pure R-run of length $`L'=r-r_0-1>(r+5)/4`$, then $`w_{r_0+1}`$ is confined to at most two adjacent integers, determined by the divisor-pulse stream alone. A chain of $`n`$ consecutive dangerous resets with long runs forces $`n-1`$ nested exact congruence towers. This shows the failure mode is a tower of exact integer coincidences, not drift; it is an ordinary argument, and it does *not* by itself exclude the two pinned values; an isolated dangerous reset after a short run is untouched by this theorem.

</div>

<a id="the-remaining--2-1-middle-cell-exclusion"></a>

#### The remaining $`-2,-1`$ middle-cell exclusion

<div class="defn">

**Definition 284**. The *two-sided cell condition* excludes three integer values of the middle coordinate, $`4\cdot\mathrm{rem}(s)-\mathrm{belowPulse}(s)-4\notin\{-3,-2,-1\}`$, plus one right-pulse-leak bound $`4\cdot\mathrm{overshoot}(s)+\mathrm{abovePulse}(s)\le2^{s+2}`$ under $`\mathrm{overshoot}(s)\le2^s`$ ([`SeamTwoSidedDyadicCellEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4374)).

</div>

Granted this, induction from a base case at row $`5`$, checked by direct computation, propagates $`\forall s\ge5,\ \mathrm{rem}(s)\le2^s\vee\mathrm{overshoot}(s)\le2^s`$ ([`SeamTwoSidedDyadicCellEscape.twoSided`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4448), given the hypothesis). One of the three cells, $`-3`$, is already closed unconditionally in the all-right-tail configuration ([`finalMiddleCell_neg_three_not_last`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderFinalMiddleCellEscape.lean#L587)). The two remaining cells, $`-2`$ and $`-1`$, are not excluded: what would complete this route is their exclusion for the actual quotient-greedy orbit (not a hypothetical one), together with the right-pulse-leak inequality. This excludes specified integer values in one coordinate. The square-root reset condition instead bounds the magnitude of a different quantity by a rank-dependent threshold. Their numerical widths do not order the two hypotheses, and no implication between them is established here.

A distinct sufficient condition concerns upper resets only. For every $`d\ge13`$ at which the upper carry occurs, set $`E_d=4\mathrm{overshoot}(d)+\mathrm{abovePulse}(d)`$ and require, for every $`0\le j\le d`$,
``` math
2^{d-j+1}<E_d\quad\text{or}\quad
 E_d+2(d+j)\le2^{d-j+1}.
```
This is the upper-reset band condition of Theorem <a href="#thm:upper-reset-band" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:upper-reset-band">53</a> ([`SeamUpperResetDyadicBandEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4566)). It is unproved in general, and verified by exact finite computation for rows $`13\le d\le30`$ ([`seamUpperResetDyadicBandEscape_through_thirty`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderUpperResetBandCertificates.lean#L78)). This band has linear width $`O(d)`$, whereas the other bound uses a width of order $`2^{d/2}`$. The quantities being bounded are different, so this comparison of widths does not prove a logical implication or strict weakening. The linear-width condition suffices for half-membership ([`half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_upperResetDyadicBandEscape`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfCylinderMiddleCarryLowerBound.lean#L4790)). It is proved logically equivalent to a single-critical-index check per row ([`seamUpperResetCriticalBandEscape_iff`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/HalfUpperResetCriticalBand.lean#L883)), which is a genuine quantifier-complexity reduction, not a strength reduction.

<a id="whether-one-twenty-first-is-represented"></a>

#### Whether one twenty-first is represented

For the second rational target, the recorded equivalence is
``` math
\frac1{21}\in\mathcal A
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 \text{$\mathcal F_{21}$ does not hold}
```
([`one_div_twenty_one_mem_iff_not_fatalAlignedBranch`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TwentyOneQuotientGreedy.lean#L3507)). The fatal branch $`\mathcal F_{21}`$ means a finite fatal greedy gap followed by cofinite exact selection, eventual quotient/rational alignment, and eventual visits to every doubling block. If it occurs, the canonical quotient remainder is eventually strictly larger than $`2^R`$ and follows one explicit affine recurrence: [`twentyOneFatalAlignedBranch_eventually_strict_supercapacity`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TwentyOneQuotientGreedy.lean#L5625) and [`twentyOneFatalAlignedBranch_eventually_affine_supercapacity`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TwentyOneQuotientGreedy.lean#L5658). Any unbounded sequence of closed returns instead proves membership.

No finite support on ranks at least $`2`$ sums to $`1/21`$ ([`finiteErdosSum_ne_one_div_twenty_one`](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos257/HalfCounterexampleFrontier.lean#L61)). Thus membership would already be an infinite-support rational counterexample to $`\mathrm{U257}`$. The missing step is to exclude the fatal aligned affine-supercapacity branch (or force unbounded closed returns); neither is proved.

<a id="possible-inputs-and-their-scope"></a>

#### Possible inputs and their scope

The following comparisons identify missing hypotheses in the recorded arguments. They neither predict the length of a proof nor classify all possible methods.

**The universal statement.** The question is $`\mathrm{U257}`$ itself. The stronger schema $`\mathrm{O1'}=\forall A\,\mathrm{Cert}(A)`$ is a rejected sufficient strengthening, not future work: Proposition <a href="#prop:squarefree" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:squarefree">274</a> already exhibits a squarefree support on which neither the digitwise nor the carry-aware block certificate exists, while Duverney–Tachiya still prove that squarefree value irrational. Supplying $`\mathrm{Cert}(A)`$ for arbitrary infinite supports is therefore not an open equivalent normal form of $`\mathrm{U257}`$. The remaining work is the universal irrationality statement, or a different method that covers supports the certificate schemas cannot.

**Half-membership, exact sums and middle cells.** The sharp-capacity gap $`(\ast)\to(\ast\ast)`$ and the $`-2,-1`$ middle-cell exclusion are both, at bottom, requests for anti-concentration of an explicit divisor-count quantity ($`\ensuremath{S}`$, or $`4\cdot\mathrm{rem}-\mathrm{belowPulse}-4`$) away from specified short integer windows. A congruence argument, a quantitative distribution estimate, or another method would have to supply the stated inequalities. The reformulations do not decide which kind of argument can do so.

**Reset separation.** The specified quotient-row argument needs $`|\mathrm{rem}(r+1)-2^{r+1}|>2^{(r+5)/2}`$ at its reset rows. A weighted divisor window is one proposed source of information. After division by $`2^{r+1}`$, the displayed condition becomes $`|\lambda_{r+1}|>2^{(3-r)/2}`$. A bound for $`\operatorname{dist}(\Theta_L(M),\mathbb Z)`$ concerns a different quantity; Section <a href="#sec:invent-R1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:invent-R1">11.1</a> displays the additional skip-set term that a transfer argument would need to control. No such implication or uniform estimate is supplied. Part IV compares this with a totient-window hypothesis for a particular argument about Problem 249. The analogy does not identify the two statements, transfer a theorem between them, or show that either hypothesis is necessary for its original problem.

<a id="summary"></a>

#### Summary

The results here do not decide the universal statement $`\mathrm{U257}`$ or the two rational membership targets $`1/2`$ and $`1/21`$. The conditions surveyed here have different logical roles. Those equivalent to half-membership, including exact sums at unbounded depths by Proposition <a href="#prop:collapsed-list" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prop:collapsed-list">18</a>(c), do not establish membership merely by reformulating it. The sufficient conditions (the reset bound, the remaining middle-cell exclusions and the capacity band (O3-supply)) have not been established at unboundedly many indices, and no converse is proved for them. The proposed universal certificate strengthening $`\mathrm{O1'}`$ is a separate, rejected statement: it is already false on squarefree support. Finite computational checks, however large their margins, are distinct from all these quantified assertions. The sufficient support theorems in the first part are proved for their stated classes. The identities, finite checks and equivalences in this section organise the remaining questions but do not resolve either rational target or the universal problem.

<a id="sec:257-logarithmic-sampling"></a>

### Logarithmic cost under arithmetic sampling

Positive fractional covers retain their geometric-kernel estimate, but their optimised cost cannot be bounded uniformly by a positive logarithmic divisor cost. The obstruction occurs on complete arithmetic periods, rather than only in incomplete-period errors. We give the construction and the surviving initial-interval estimate here; the short note records their consequences beside its cube-family calculation.

The proofs in this section are ordinary arguments, given here in full, and have not had independent review. For the underlying Lambert subseries, Kovač–Tao treat the same fixed-base object in \[kovactao, Section 2.1.2 and Remark 4.1\]; their strict-tail argument gives distinct support coding and Cantor topology. Van Doorn–Kovač treat a freely chosen denominator sequence. Their convention is $`n_{i+1}/n_i\ge\lambda`$ at every index. For each $`1<\lambda<2`$, they construct such a sequence whose finite reciprocal sums include every rational in $`[0,2]`$; no sequence with $`n_{i+1}/n_i\ge2`$ can do this on any nonempty open interval \[vandoornkovac, Theorem 1, Lemma 4 and Corollary 5\]. This is a statement about the rational points of an interval, not an interval consisting entirely of finite sums; there are only countably many finite subsets. Those results provide context, not an arithmetic logarithmic estimate or a solution of fixed-base rational membership. The proof dependencies below are positive divisor majorisation, elementary prime selection, the Chinese remainder theorem, and the original kernel estimate <a href="#eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel">[eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel]</a>. The short note’s logarithmic lower bound and cube-family calculation concern the same fractional-cover cost; their structured upper bound is not a uniform logarithmic converse.

<a id="the-two-finite-costs"></a>

#### The two finite costs

Let $`F`$ be a finite nonempty subset of $`\mathbb N_{>0}`$, and write
``` math
Q=\operatorname{lcm}(F),\qquad f_F(n)=\#\{a\in F:a\mid n\},\qquad
 U_F(N)=\sum_{r\ge1}2^{-r}f_F(N+r)
       =\sum_{a\in F}\frac{2^{N\bmod a}}{2^a-1}.
```
For $`0<t\le1`$ define, with natural logarithms,
``` math
\begin{equation}
 \kappa_1(F;t)=\min\left\{\sum_{d\mid Q}\frac{c_d}{d}:
 c_d\ge0,\quad
 \log(1+f_F(s)/t)\le\sum_{d\mid s}c_d\quad(s\mid Q)\right\}.
 \label{eq:257-logarithmic-cost}
\end{equation}
```
The constraints also hold at every positive integer $`n`$, by replacing $`n`$ with $`\gcd(n,Q)`$. The programme is finite and feasible; a bounded cost sublevel bounds each coefficient, so its minimum is attained. For $`L\ge1`$, let $`\mathbb P_L`$ be uniform sampling of $`N=Lm`$ over a period of $`U_F(Lm)`$, for which $`Q/\gcd(Q,L)`$ is a permissible length. This notation does not assert that the displayed period is least.

We use $`K_*(F)`$ for the infimum of the existing fractional-cover cost
``` math
\begin{equation}
 K=\sum_j\frac{C_j\eta_j^{-\alpha_j}}{2^{\alpha_j}-1},\qquad
 C_j=\sum_{d\ge1}\frac{c_{j,d}}d,
 \label{eq:257-optimised-cover-cost}
\end{equation}
```
over finite or countable families of finite sets $`F_j`$ of positive integers covering $`F`$, exponents $`0<\alpha_j\le1`$, weights $`\eta_j>0`$ with $`\sum_j\eta_j=1`$, and coefficients $`c_{j,d}\ge0`$ satisfying $`f_{F_j}(n)^{\alpha_j}\le\sum_{d\mid n}c_{j,d}`$ for every $`n\ge1`$. The covering sets need not be disjoint or contained in $`F`$. Covers of infinite cost do not lower the infimum, and a finite-cost cover exists, for example the single set $`F`$ with exponent one. This is the manuscript’s fractional cost, not a redefinition of the logarithmic cost.

**Theorem 285** (arithmetic logarithmic counterexample). *For every integer $`H\ge2`$ and every real $`A_0\ge0`$, there are a squarefree positive integer $`L`$ and a finite nonempty set $`F`$ of distinct squarefree positive integers such that

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* The modulus makes many small divisor conditions automatic. Fresh tag primes then make the remaining incidences independent, and taking all least common multiples turns their number into an exponential incidence. A logarithm pays only for the individual tags, while the shifted potential can exceed one at many different offsets.

Choose a finite set of primes $`P`$ such that, with
``` math
L=\prod_{p\in P}p,\qquad D=\tau(L),\qquad
 B=\prod_{p\in P}(1+1/p),
```
we have $`B\ge H^2`$. Such a set exists because the sum of reciprocal primes diverges and $`\log(1+1/p)\ge1/(2p)`$. Here $`\tau`$ counts positive divisors and $`\sigma`$ denotes their sum. Complementary divisors satisfy
``` math
\frac{\sigma(r)}r\,
 \frac{\sigma(L/r)}{L/r}=B\qquad(r\mid L).
```
Thus the set $`G=\{r\mid L:\sigma(r)/r\ge H\}`$ has at least $`D/2`$ elements. Also $`D\ge B\ge H^2`$.

Choose a finite set $`\mathcal B`$ of parent primes, all exceeding $`\max\{L,H,D,A_0\}`$, with
``` math
\frac4D\le\sum_{q\in\mathcal B}\frac1q\le\frac5D.
```
Divergence of the prime reciprocal sum after any finite cutoff permits stopping at the first crossing of $`4/D`$; the overshoot is less than $`1/D`$. For each $`q\in\mathcal B`$ and $`d\mid L`$, choose a finite set $`T_{q,d}`$ of tag primes, all greater than $`H`$, disjoint from $`P`$, from $`\mathcal B`$, and from every other tag set, such that
``` math
\frac{4d}{H}\le S_{q,d}:=\sum_{p\in T_{q,d}}\frac1p\le\frac{5d}{H}.
```
The same stopping argument works successively: each new reciprocal is less than $`1/H\le d/H`$, and only finitely many primes have been excluded. No bound on the size of these prime sets is needed.

Let $`\mathcal I_q=\{(d,p):d\mid L,\ p\in T_{q,d}\}`$, and define
``` math
F_q=\left\{q\operatorname{lcm}\{dp:(d,p)\in I\}:
                         I\subseteq\mathcal I_q\right\},
 \qquad F=\bigcup_{q\in\mathcal B}F_q,
```
where the least common multiple of the empty set is one. Every tag prime occurs in just one labelled pair. Its presence in the least common multiple therefore recovers whether that pair was selected. Hence different subsets give distinct exponents. All exponents are squarefree; different parent primes give disjoint sets, since no parent prime occurs in any other set. Their minimum is greater than $`\max\{L,A_0\}`$. The nonempty tag sets with $`d=L`$ also show $`L\mid Q`$.

For an integer $`n\ge1`$ put $`Z_q(n)=\sum_{(d,p)\in\mathcal I_q}\mathbf1_{\{dp\mid n\}}`$. The least-common-multiple encoding gives the exact identity
``` math
f_{F_q}(n)=\mathbf1_{\{q\mid n\}}2^{Z_q(n)}.
```
Indeed, when $`q\mid n`$, a selected least common multiple divides $`n`$ exactly when every selected pair does. Consequently
``` math
\log(1+f_{F_q}(n))
 \le(\log2)\left(\mathbf1_{\{q\mid n\}}
          +\sum_{(d,p)\in\mathcal I_q}\mathbf1_{\{qdp\mid n\}}\right).
```
All moduli in this majorant divide $`\operatorname{lcm}(F_q)`$. Its cost is at most
``` math
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\log2}{q}\left(1+\sum_{d\mid L}\frac{S_{q,d}}d\right)
 \le\frac{\log2}{q}(1+5D/H).
 \label{eq:257-parent-log-cost}
\end{equation}
```

Now sample $`N`$ uniformly modulo $`Q`$, subject to $`L\mid N`$. For $`r\in G`$, the event $`q\mid N+r`$ has probability $`1/q`$. For a fixed parent these events are disjoint as $`1\le r\le L<q`$. Conditional on one such event, the tag-prime events remain independent by the Chinese remainder theorem. Since $`d\mid N+r`$ is equivalent to $`d\mid r`$, the mean of $`Z_q(N+r)`$ is
``` math
\mu_r=\sum_{d\mid r}S_{q,d}
 \ge\frac4H\sigma(r)\ge4r,
```
and its variance is at most $`\mu_r`$. Chebyshev’s inequality gives
``` math
\mathbb P_L\bigl(Z_q(N+r)<r\mid q\mid N+r\bigr)
 \le\frac{\mu_r}{(\mu_r-r)^2}
 \le\frac4{9r}\le\frac49.
```
Thus success has conditional probability at least $`1/2`$. On success the $`r`$th term of $`U_{F_q}(N)`$ is at least $`2^{-r}2^r=1`$. Later positive terms, for example those supplied by the exponent $`q\in F_q`$, make $`U_{F_q}(N)>1`$ strictly. The event $`E_q`$ of success for some $`r\in G`$ consequently satisfies
``` math
\mathbb P_L(E_q)\ge\frac{|G|}{2q}\ge\frac{D}{4q}.
```
Different parent groups depend on disjoint prime coordinates, so the $`E_q`$ are independent under this conditional uniform measure. It follows that
``` math
\mathbb P_L(U_F>1)\ge
 1-\prod_{q\in\mathcal B}(1-\mathbb P_L(E_q))
 \ge1-\exp\left(-\frac D4\sum_{q\in\mathcal B}\frac1q\right)
 \ge1-e^{-1}.
```
Since $`f_F=\sum_qf_{F_q}`$ and $`\log(1+\sum_qx_q)\le\sum_q\log(1+x_q)`$ for $`x_q\ge0`$, we may sum the positive majorants in <a href="#eq:257-parent-log-cost" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-parent-log-cost">[eq:257-parent-log-cost]</a>:
``` math
\kappa_1(F;1)\le\frac{5\log2}{D}(1+5D/H)
 \le\frac{30\log2}{H}.
```

Since $`L\mid Q`$, write $`P_0=Q/L`$ and $`p=\mathbb P_L(U_F>1)`$. The bounded periodic sequence $`\mathbf1_{\{U_F(Lm)>1\}}`$ satisfies, for every integer $`T\ge1`$,
``` math
\left|\frac1T\sum_{m=1}^{T}\mathbf1_{\{U_F(Lm)>1\}}-p\right|
 \le\frac{P_0}{T}.
```
Summing over the dyadic window gives
``` math
\left|\mathscr D_{L;R,M}\mathbf1_{\{U_F>1\}}-p\right|
 \le\frac{2P_0}{M2^R}.
```
Take $`M=L`$ and $`2^R\ge16P_0`$. The error is at most $`1/8`$, whereas $`p\ge1-e^{-1}>5/8`$, so the mean exceeds $`1/2`$. A putative bound (E) would instead give at most $`60C\log2/H`$. Choosing an integer $`H>120C\log2`$ contradicts it. ◻

**Corollary 286** (finite-functional separation). *For every finite nonempty $`F`$, with $`Q=\operatorname{lcm}(F)`$,
``` math
\begin{equation}
 K_*(F)\ge\max_{\ell\mid Q}
   \mathbb P\bigl(U_F(N)>1\mid\ell\mid N\bigr),
 \label{eq:257-arithmetic-cover-lower}
\end{equation}
```
where $`N`$ is uniform modulo $`Q`$. The supports of Theorem <a href="#thm:257-logarithmic-counterexample" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:257-logarithmic-counterexample">285</a> satisfy $`K_*(F)\ge1-e^{-1}`$ and $`\kappa_1(F;1)\le30\log2/H`$. In particular, no absolute $`C`$ gives $`K_*(F)\le C\kappa_1(F;1)`$ for all finite nonempty $`F`$, even after all covering sets, exponents, coefficients and positive weights have been optimised.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Fix one finite-cost cover in <a href="#eq:257-optimised-cover-cost" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-optimised-cover-cost">[eq:257-optimised-cover-cost]</a>, and write $`U_j=U_{F_j}`$ and $`B_j=2^{\alpha_j}`$. Coverage gives $`U_F\le\sum_jU_j`$. If $`U_F>1`$, then $`U_j>\eta_j`$ for at least one index. Subadditivity and the divisor majorants therefore give the pointwise estimate
``` math
\mathbf1_{\{U_F>1\}}
 \le\sum_j\eta_j^{-\alpha_j}U_j^{\alpha_j}
 \le\sum_{j,d}\eta_j^{-\alpha_j}c_{j,d}w_{B_j,d}.
```
Nonnegative interchange and the original geometric-kernel estimate <a href="#eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel">[eq:257-mixed-finite-kernel]</a>, with its factor $`1+4L/M`$, imply
``` math
\mathscr D_{L;R,M}\mathbf1_{\{U_F>1\}}\le(1+4L/M)K.
```
For fixed $`L,M`$, let $`R`$ tend to infinity. Periodicity of the left-hand indicator gives $`\mathbb P_L(U_F>1)\le(1+4L/M)K`$. Then let $`M`$ tend to infinity, with $`L`$ fixed, to obtain $`\mathbb P_L(U_F>1)\le K`$. For $`L=\ell\mid Q`$ this is the conditional probability in the statement. It holds for every admissible cover, so take their infimum and the maximum over the finitely many divisors $`\ell`$. Finally use the constructed $`L\mid Q`$ and let $`H`$ tend to infinity. ◻

**Proposition 287** (ordinary initial intervals). *For every finite nonempty $`F`$, integer $`X\ge1`$, and $`0<t\le1`$,
``` math
\frac1X\#\{1\le N\le X:U_F(N)>t\}
 \le\frac{2}{\log(4/3)}\kappa_1(F;t).
```*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Choose a positive logarithmic divisor majorant $`g(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}c_d`$ of cost $`K=\sum_{d\mid Q}c_d/d`$, putting $`c_d=0`$ when $`d\nmid Q`$, and let $`a=\log(4/3)`$. For positive integers $`n,Y`$,
``` math
g(n)\le Kn,\qquad
 \sum_{n=1}^{Y}g(n)=\sum_{d\mid Q}c_d\lfloor Y/d\rfloor\le KY.
```
If $`U_F(N)>t`$, there is an $`r\ge1`$ with $`\log(1+f_F(N+r)/t)>ar`$. Otherwise every $`f_F(N+r)/t\le(4/3)^r-1`$, and
``` math
\frac{U_F(N)}t\le\sum_{r\ge1}2^{-r}\bigl((4/3)^r-1\bigr)=1,
```
a contradiction. If $`K\ge a/2`$ the required counting bound is trivial. For $`K<a/2`$, a witnessing integer $`n=N+r`$ satisfies $`a(n-N)<g(n)\le Kn`$, whence $`n<aN/(a-K)\le2X`$ when $`N\le X`$. A fixed $`n`$ can witness at most $`g(n)/a`$ integer values of $`N`$, since $`1\le n-N<g(n)/a`$. The union bound thus gives
``` math
\#\{1\le N\le X:U_F(N)>t\}
 \le\frac1a\sum_{n=1}^{2X}g(n)\le\frac{2KX}{a}.
```
Take the infimum over the admissible majorants. ◻

</div>

The proposition also bounds every $`L=1`$ dyadic observation window, since such a window averages ordinary initial-interval means. It does not bound conditional arithmetic sampling uniformly in $`L`$. Freezing a finite initial support in the irrationality argument requires exactly that arithmetic restriction. The proposed logarithmic-tail irrationality corollary therefore loses this proof; its conclusion is not disproved. The corollary above separates finite functionals, not infinite-support irrationality classes. The weighted, fractional-cover, mixed and finite-period noncollapse results are unchanged. No conclusion here decides universal \#257 or membership of $`1/2`$ or $`1/21`$.

<a id="two-proof-details-and-sources"></a>

### Two proof details and sources

The elementary atom comparison can be sharpened to $`\Delta_{b,A}(N)\le\Delta_{2,A}(N)`$ for all real $`b\ge2`$. After cancelling $`b-1`$, differentiate the ratio $`\sum_{i<r}b^i/\sum_{i<d}b^i`$: its numerator is $`\sum_{i<r\le j<d}(i-j)b^{i+j-1}\le0`$. Only the rational-lattice step needs an integer base.

For the scalar positive-cover cost, put $`z=\log_2t`$. Direct differentiation of $`y^z/(y-1)`$ on $`1<y\le2`$ gives
``` math
\Psi(t)=t\quad(1\le t\le4),\qquad
 \Psi(t)=\frac{z^z}{(z-1)^{z-1}}\quad(t>4).
```
These are ordinary proof details.

The original periodic and linear-independence papers of Luca and Tachiya are now distinguished from their later overview \[lucatachiya2014periodic; lucatachiya2014independence; lucatachiya2017\]. Their theorem formulations used here were read in the author-written overview; the two original publisher PDFs were not retrieved. Van Assche’s nonvanishing and small-linear-form argument for the full Lambert series \[vanassche2001, Lemma 1 and (34)–(35)\] is a comparator for the missing upper-height control, not a result for arbitrary thinnings.

For achievement-set background, Hornich’s original bibliographic record \[hornich1941\] is separated from the exposition actually used here \[nitecki2013\]. Głąb and Prus-Wiśniowski’s survey \[glabprus2025\] provides a modern map of geometry and cardinality questions, not a rational-membership theorem for the present set.

The theorem on p. 222 treats pairwise-coprime support with convergent reciprocal sum at every integer base $`b\ge2`$; the claimed removal of pairwise coprimality is stated without proof. The same page says the reciprocal-sum condition could be replaced by a weaker but more complicated condition, and p. 226 suggests $`\sum_{n_i<x}1/n_i=o(\log\log x)`$ for pairwise coprime supports.

Theorem A (p. 139) restates Theorem 1.1 of their paper *Irrationality of Lambert series associated with a periodic sequence*, Int. J. Number Theory 10 (2014), no. 3, 623–636, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1142/S1793042113501121): for a purely periodic integer sequence $`a(n)`$, not identically zero, $`\sum_{n\ge1}a(n)/(q^n-1)`$ is irrational for every integer $`q`$ with $`|q|>1`$. Example 2 (p. 140) treats the odd support. Z. Nitecki, [*Subsum sets: intervals, Cantor sets, and Cantorvals*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3779v2), arXiv:1106.3779v2 (2013). Theorem 4 (p. 9) shows that when every term exceeds its tail the subsum set is a Cantor set of Lebesgue measure $`\lim_n2^nX_n`$, where $`X_n`$ is the $`n`$th tail, and credits this to H. Hornich (1941).

The averaged tail $`R_c(q,x,z)`$, a sum over offsets $`j\ge z`$, is (1.7) and Theorem 1 is on p. 3; its rational-integer form, Theorem 3, is on p. 5. Lemma 1 (pp. 6–7) derives irrationality from arbitrarily small nonzero scaled tails, and Lemma 2 (pp. 7–8) shows that most scaled tails in a range are small under a counting condition on the support. Their criteria assume sparse coefficient supports.

Page numbers refer to the linked author preprint. Theorem 1.1 (pp. 2–3) is the refined Chowla–Erdős criterion; its proof in Section 2 (pp. 5–7) selects an index by minimising a local coefficient mass along an arithmetic progression, (2.3)–(2.9). Corollary 1.2 gives the general $`F_s(E)`$ theorem and its monomial images under $`|q|\operatorname{lcm}(1,\dots,\ell)\le s`$, and at every integer base when $`s=\infty`$; Example 1.1 gives the joint squarefree family at all bases $`2^j`$, $`j\ge1`$. Both are on p. 4, which also relates Corollary 1.2 to the conjecture of Erdős and Graham; the proof of Corollary 1.2 is on pp. 10–11.

Theorem 1.3 (p. 4) proves $`\sum_{n\ge1}\omega(n)/2^n=\sum_p(2^p-1)^{-1}`$ irrational, settling the prime-support case of \#257 at base $`2`$; the paragraph after it states that the prime-support result extends to every integer base $`b\ge2`$, and separately that full prime-power support is irrational at base $`2`$. The modifications for those two assertions are left to the reader; arbitrary subsets of the primes or prime powers are not treated there.

Theorem 1 (p. 154) gives $`\mu(h_p(1))\le2.46497868\ldots`$ for $`h_p(1)=\sum_{n\ge1}1/(p^n-1)`$, uniformly in the integer $`p`$ with $`|p|\ge2`$; the remark at the end of Section 3 (p. 159) corrects the computation of the author’s earlier paper.
