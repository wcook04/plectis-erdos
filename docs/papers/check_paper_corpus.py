"""Check that this repository's paper corpus still matches its manuscripts.

Generated file. This script is copied verbatim into each public repository by
``export_paper_corpus.py`` in the private system repository; edit it there.

The corpus under ``docs/papers/`` is exported by a tool that needs pandoc and a
checkout of both public repositories. Neither is available here, so this check
does not regenerate anything. It verifies what can be verified locally and
cheaply: every manuscript and every shipped PDF recorded in ``corpus.json``
still hashes to the value the corpus was built from.

That catches the failure that actually happens -- someone edits a paper and the
generated text silently keeps describing the old one -- using nothing but the
standard library, so it can run in any CI job.

Exit status is 0 when the corpus is current, 1 when a manuscript has moved on,
and 2 when the corpus is missing or unreadable.
