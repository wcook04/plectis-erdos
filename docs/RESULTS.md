# Results and limits

This repository formalises finite results, reductions, equivalences, and
obstructions related to Erdős Problems 249 and 257. It does not solve either
problem.

Lean source checked by the pinned Lean kernel is proof authority. The audit log
reports the headline declarations below with kernel assumptions
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. A theorem with hypotheses proves only
the displayed implication; it does not prove that its hypotheses occur.

## Ten-minute verdict

Both Erdős problems remain open. The development is neither a partial solution
nor an empty collection of restatements. Its checked non-restatement centre
includes:

- for #257, exact finite-period noncollapse, eventually-periodic support
  irrationality, a signed periodic-weight dichotomy, feedback and rank-gap
  theorems, and a precisely delimited squarefree-support barrier;
- for #249, exact finite-level ranks and infinite-dimensionality for dyadic
  sections of Euler's totient, denominator growth for a Möbius-shadow object,
  and scoped barriers and case trichotomies; and
- finite evidence: a diagonal certificate band through `t=82` and a historical
  roster of 123 distinct off-diagonal certificates (125 verified log rows),
  neither of which supplies the required unbounded family.

The project also audits its own conditional routes. Of 23 substantial Lean
propositions extracted from hypotheses of conditional theorems, 17 are
provably equivalent to an endpoint—14 to #249 and 3 to the `1/2` membership
test for #257. This is a self-diagnosis of reformulation failure, not progress
on either endpoint.

<!-- BEGIN semantic_public_census -->
Only after those theorem-level facts comes the corpus census. The current semantic graph provides three diagnostic views across every indexed Erdős problem:

| View | #68 | #243 | #249 | #251 | #257 | #269 | #1041 | #1049 | both | shared | total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| mechanically nonrecurring candidates | 0 | 3 | 85 | 0 | 168 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 19 | 280 |
| classical/prior-art formalisations | 0 | 1 | 36 | 0 | 23 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 40 | 101 |
| bare open-problem equivalences | 0 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 32 |

The nonrecurring view contains 180 unconditional object theorems, 54 scoped barriers, and 46 reductions or transports after aliases, open antecedents, bare equivalences, finite/generated instances, infrastructure, classical results, and routine corollaries are removed.

The internal adjudicated frontier shortlist contains 11 nodes; it is distinct from the 8-node public prior-art review queue. 228 nonrecurring candidates remain unassessed for prior art. The live authored open-antecedent surface has 52 clusters, of which 10 are marked endpoint-equivalent. None of these populations is a novelty census.
<!-- END semantic_public_census -->

The large #249 denominator exclusion is a direct, kernel-checked instantiation
of the classical neighbouring-fraction/mediant method. That method supplies the
displayed bound exactly (numerical delta `0`). The local addition is the checked
arithmetic instance, its transfers, and its sharp first failure.

The census is reproducible with:

```sh
python3 scripts/query_semantic.py nonrecurring
python3 scripts/query_semantic.py bare-equivalences
python3 scripts/query_semantic.py classical
python3 scripts/query_semantic.py open-antecedents
```

## What is proved

### Settled support families for Problem 257

The universal problem is open, but several infinite supports are settled.
The formal source proves irrationality in every integer base `b≥2` for the
full support, factorials, powers of two, multiples of a fixed positive integer,
residue classes, the odd numbers, eventually periodic supports, and pairwise
coprime supports with summable reciprocals. The relevant declarations include:

- `irrational_erdosSum_full_support`;
- `erdos257_family_factorial_instance` and
  `erdos257_family_two_pow_instance`;
- `irrational_erdosSupportSeries_multiples`,
  `irrational_erdosSupportSeries_residueClass`, and
  `irrational_erdosSupportSeries_odd`;
- `irrational_erdosSupportSeries_eventuallyPeriodic`; and
- `irrational_erdosSupportSeries_pairwise_coprime`.

These declarations are in `Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean`. The prime and
prime-power supports are literature results cited by the repository, not
formalised here.

The squarefree support remains open. Its divisor incidence is proved to be
`2^ω(n)-1`, hence odd at every `n≥2`. The certificate engines in this
development begin by selecting an even-incidence block, so they cannot act on
that support at any block position. The checked declarations
`card_squarefreeDivisors`, `squarefreeIncidence_eq`, and
`odd_squarefreeIncidence` are in
`ErdosProblems/Erdos257/SquarefreeSupportIncidence.lean`. This is a limitation
of the named engines, not evidence that the squarefree-support value is
rational or irrational.

### The reduction chain for the one-half test case of Problem 257

The Mersenne achievement set consists of subsums of
`1/(2^n-1)`. If `1/2` belongs to it, its support gives an infinite set with a
rational subseries, which would refute the universal statement in Problem 257.
The repository does not prove this membership.

The checked chain includes:

- `half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_iff_greedySkippedSupport_infinite` in
  `Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean`: membership of `1/2` is equivalent to
  infinitely many skips in its greedy expansion.
- `half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_iff_unboundedTerminalFalse` in
  `Erdos249257/HalfCylinderHalfMembershipClassification.lean`: the same
  membership is equivalent to terminal false bits beyond every bound.
- `half_mem_iff_unboundedLargestSkipLate` in
  `ErdosProblems/Skip/D2.lean`: membership is equivalent to late largest skips
  beyond every bound.
- `exists_largestSkipLateAt_of_remainder_le_two_pow` in
  `ErdosProblems/Bit/R2.lean`: a row with remainder at most `2^N` produces a
  late largest skip in the explicit interval `[N+1,2N+1]`.
- `half_mem_of_remainderReachesHalfPointCofinally` in
  `ErdosProblems/Bit/R2.lean`: remainders at most `2^s` cofinally are sufficient
  for membership.

The final two bullets are one-way sufficient criteria. They are not
equivalences and are not known to hold cofinally.

The proposed universal `hlow` side condition is false:
`not_hlow_seven_five` in `ErdosProblems/Decl/D4.lean` and
`not_hlow_of_hhigh` in `ErdosProblems/Hlow/H1.lean` give the counterexample
`(s,d) = (7,5)`. Its failure is useful rather than obstructive:
`seamRemainder_lt_two_pow_of_not_hlow` and
`seven_is_a_hit_from_failure` in `ErdosProblems/Hlow/H2.lean` convert that
failure into a hit certificate.

### Exact ranks for dyadic sections of Euler's totient

For `j ≥ 0` and `0 ≤ r < 2^j`, let
`φ_(j,r)(n) = φ(2^j n + r)`. The family consisting of `φ_(0,0)`,
`φ_(1,0)`, and all `φ_(j,r)` with odd `r` is a rational basis for the span of
all dyadic sections. At level `e`, the span has dimension exactly `2^e + 1`.

Lean names and sources:

- `linearIndependent_oddCoreTotientKernelFamily`,
  `span_range_fullTotientKernel_eq_span_range_oddCore`, and
  `totientDyadicSectionBasis` in
  `Erdos249257/TotientMahlerDefect.lean`;
- `finrank_canonicalTotientKernel_eq` in the same file.

These are theorems about the coefficient sequence `φ`. They do not prove that
`∑ φ(n)/2^n` is irrational.

### A finite diagonal certificate band for Problem 249

Let `periodLcm t = lcm(1,…,t)`. The predicate
`certifiedKill h N L` is a finite modular-arithmetic certificate showing that a
specific binary totient-tail difference at shift `h` and position `N` is not an
integer.

`exists_diagonalKill_le_82` proves

```text
for every t ≤ 82, there is an L such that
certifiedKill (periodLcm t) (periodLcm t) L.
```

Lean name and source:

- `exists_diagonalKill_le_82` —
  `ErdosProblems/Skip/LadderT67.lean`

The exact least depths at the new boundary scales are:

| Scale `t` | Least depth `L` | Lean name | File |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 67 | 100 | `t67_minimal_depth` | `ErdosProblems/Lift/Recon67.lean` |
| 71 | 105 | `t71_minimal_depth` | `ErdosProblems/Lift/CertT67.lean` |
| 73 | 113 | `t73_minimal_depth` | `ErdosProblems/Skip/LadderT67.lean` |
| 79 | 120 | `t79_minimal_depth` | `ErdosProblems/Skip/LadderT67.lean` |
| 81 | 120 | `t81_minimal_depth` | `ErdosProblems/Skip/LadderT67.lean` |

The same file proves

```text
periodLcm 79 = 32433859254793982911622772305630400,
```

a 35-digit modulus, as `periodLcm_79_value`.

The source-backed
[`checked_diagonal_depth_roster.json`](measurements/checked_diagonal_depth_roster.json)
covers all 33 distinct `periodLcm` scales whose plateaux fill the positive band
`t≤82`. Every recorded working depth lies `0…4` above the arithmetic
admissibility floor (median `1`, mean `40/33`). Only the five boundary scales
`t=67,71,73,79,81` have separate theorems proving their recorded depths least;
for the other 28 scales, the excess is only an upper bound on the least-depth
excess. Reproduce the roster with:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_checked_diagonal_depth_roster.py --check
```

This is a bounded result. The reduction for Problem 249 requires certificates
at arbitrarily large scales. The theorem says nothing at `t = 83`.

### Finite off-diagonal certificates

The historical audit selects 125 verified log rows at positions not constrained
to equal `periodLcm t`. Two pairs of rows repeat the same `(h,N,L)` triple, so
the roster contains 123 distinct certificates matched to 123 public Lean
theorems across 122 files. The largest position in that audited set is:

```text
freeKill_64OneHundredFifteenDI :
  certifiedKill 1 135960691671824579163806583999 101
```

Source:
`ErdosProblems/FreePosition/FreeKill64OneHundredFifteenDI.lean`.

The generated
[`off_diagonal_certificate_roster.json`](measurements/off_diagonal_certificate_roster.json)
retains all selected source rows and their hashes, identifies both duplicate
groups, and binds each distinct triple to its exact theorem, line, and source
hash. Reproduce it with:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_off_diagonal_certificate_roster.py --check
```

The source log also contains 54 later verified certificate triples above the
historical position cutoff. The roster exposes that excluded census without
silently changing the historical result.

The relevant sufficient theorem for Problem 249 is
`irrational_totient_series_of_multiple_window_kill_supply` in
`Erdos249257/CertificateKernel.lean`. Its hypothesis requires, for every
positive base shift and every lower bound on the position, a later certificate
at some positive multiple of that shift. A finite list of 123 instances does
not establish that quantified supply.

### Direct Farey comparison

The denominator exclusion is exactly the standard Farey/mediant bound for the
two committed finite windows. The arithmetic below was recomputed from

```text
V_K = (∑_{r=1}^K φ(r+1) 2^(K-r)) mod 2^K
```

and from the explicit neighbouring fractions in
`Erdos249257/GapFareyBound.lean`.

| `K` | Interval width | Farey neighbour denominators `b,d` | `b+d-1` | Formal exclusion bound | Delta | First failing denominator |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 120 | `123/2^120` | `41326538792622579`, `207345787569745331` | `248672326362367909` | `248672326362367909` | `0` | `248672326362367910` |
| 240 | `243/2^240` | `66013429300517684370587633721421187`, `13626217346183690952768141154409867` | `79639646646701375323355774875831053` | `79639646646701375323355774875831053` | `0` | `79639646646701375323355774875831054` |

For each row, the recomputation gives determinant `1` for the two neighbours,
verifies both interval brackets, verifies the displayed bound, and verifies
failure at the next denominator. The corresponding proved declarations are
`farey_gap`, `gap_check_window_1_120_le_248672326362367909`,
`gap_check_window_1_120_first_failure`,
`gap_check_window_1_240_le_79639646646701375323355774875831053`, and
`gap_check_window_1_240_first_failure`.

The division of credit is exact: Farey supplies the bound directly;
formalisation supplies a checked arithmetic instance and proves it is sharp
for that window. Neither finite window proves that the exclusion bounds are
unbounded, so neither proves Erdős #249.

The magnitude is also a tunable window output, not an invariant measure of
progress. `scripts/check_farey_denominator_scaling.py` independently reproduces
the two formalised constants and cross-checks the producer by brute force on
six small windows. On this run, choosing `K=16000` produced a 2,406-digit bound
in `0.08` seconds for the scaling row (`0.18` seconds for the complete script).
Every fixed `K` still gives only a finite exclusion, and increasing `K` does
not supply the unbounded theorem required by #249.

### Scoped no-go theorems

These theorems rule out particular proof mechanisms. They do not rule out other
arguments.

| Lean name | Exact scope | File |
|---|---|---|
| `no_lift_from_lower_totient_data` | No universal lift of the displayed form can follow only from the stated lower totient data, pointwise bound, and a lower certificate. | `ErdosProblems/Lift/AngleA5.lean` |
| `no_window_local_lift` | For prime multipliers `p ≥ 3`, agreement on the lower diagonal window does not force any certificate in the lifted window. | `ErdosProblems/Lift/InduceLaw.lean` |
| `exists_certifiedKill_antitone` | A certificate at a larger position gives one at a smaller position; the implication runs opposite to a forward lift. | `ErdosProblems/Lift/AngleA4.lean` |
| `consecutiveFail_iff` | Under its explicit depth inequality, a run of `K` failures at depth `L` is equivalent to failure at depth `L+K` at the base position. | `ErdosProblems/Half/FreeWalk2.lean` |
| `no_absolute_bound_on_consecutive_failures` | The abstract admissible-run model permits arbitrarily long failure runs under its stated budget. | `ErdosProblems/Half/FreeWalk1.lean` |
| `exists_persistent_surplus_model` | The listed row recurrence and ceiling inequalities admit a sequence that stays above the target forever. | `ErdosProblems/Rem/C1.lean` |
| `rowLaw_blind_at_16` | At one concrete row, every listed row-level trigger is silent although the next row has a late skip. | `ErdosProblems/Rem/C1.lean` |
| `IntervalCeiling.four_pow_le` | Every ceiling satisfying the stated branch-blind rank-recursion obligations must grow on the `4^s` scale. | `ErdosProblems/Three/T1.lean` |
| `two_pow_mul_y` | The normalised state used in the doubling route is dyadic at every finite row. | `ErdosProblems/Three/T2.lean` |
| `exists_persistent_odd_surplus_model` | Adding parity to the listed row-level constraints still admits a persistent surplus model. | `ErdosProblems/Three/T3.lean` |
| `PairCeiling.terminal_ge_of_splits` | In the stated two-sided abstraction, a failed branch prediction forces the terminal upper bound above the target scale. | `ErdosProblems/Decl/D1.lean` |

### Other standalone exact obstructions

These five registry claims are not restatements of either endpoint. Each has a
separate limitation, and none settles an Erdős problem.

| Registry id | Exact checked content | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `totient_carry_kernel_anti_compression` | If `S` were rational, one rationality-supplied tempered integral carry would have canonical carry-section span dimension at least `2^e-1` for every `e`. | No finite-rank upper bound for such carries is known, so this does not contradict rationality. |
| `primitive_coordinate_index_obstruction` | Clearing `(φ*μ)(n)/n` through level `N` forces a two-tier primorial divisor; no fixed positive index clears every level. | Finite Euler-coordinate obstruction, not an irrationality criterion. |
| `lcm_factor_ideal_anchor_pulse_no_go` | For every `t≥3`, a synthetic survivor satisfies the factor-ideal and whole-ray-anchor constraints and survives every finite integer shift polynomial. | Its letters need not be actual totient differences; nonlinear fresh-divisor arguments remain possible. |
| `reciprocal_mass_bound` | A rational support value with odd denominator part `v` forces reciprocal mass at least `1/ord_v(2)`, or divergence; a dyadic-rational infinite support forces divergence or mass greater than one. | Does not exclude every rational value. |
| `unbounded_carry_states` | Every infinite support with rational series value has an unbounded positive carry state. | Rules out finite-state interpretations, not rationality itself. |

### Demand ledger

A demand is an unproved hypothesis extracted from a conditional theorem and
stored as a named Lean proposition. `ErdosProblems/DemandLedger/Basic.lean`
contains 101 named closed propositions; 23 are labelled substantive and the
rest are side conditions. The current prose frontier contains 52 entries.

The extraction snapshot in the audit log records 144 proved implication edges
among the 23 substantive demands, producing seven equivalence classes.
Seventeen substantive demands collapse to restatements of an open target rather
than smaller subproblems. For example:

- `G103_iff_erdos249` in
  `ErdosProblems/DemandLedger/edges/Discharge3_G103.lean` proves that the
  general lcm-window supply `G103` is equivalent to Problem 249 itself.
- `G103_iff_G097` in the same file identifies two supply formulations.
- `e_G083_G084` in `edges/ClusterE.lean` records one implication in the
  Problem 257 chain.

The ledger classifies obligations. It does not discharge an obligation merely
by naming it or proving it equivalent to the target.

## What is measured, not proved

Only measurements with an explicit tested range and explicit exception set are
listed here. Counts without preserved sample identities are not promoted to
release results.

| Measurement | Exact range | Exact failures or mismatches | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Recon257.seamExcess s = 2` | `s = 5,…,102` (two overlapping scans, `5…64` and `58…102`) | No occurrence. | MEASURED. This makes the audited uses at `s=D+1`, `D≥60`, unobserved. |
| Three-row `hcof` on the seven audited survivor values | `D = {101,122,164,314,545,629,1112}` | Fails at all seven values. | MEASURED; every audited case satisfying `hcof` already died by depth 3. |
| Residual invariant | `s = 6,…,3000`, `d = 2,…,s-1` | Exactly `(s,d)=(13,7)`; residual `524419`, bound `524288`. | The exception is also PROVED by `Three/T1.not_residualInvariant`. Maximum ratio away from the exception was `0.9999807` at `(606,602)`. |
| `hlow` and `hhigh` at late pairs | all late pairs with `s = 5,…,600` | `hlow` fails exactly at `(7,5)`; `hhigh` fails exactly at `(5,4)`. | The `hlow` exception is PROVED in `Decl/D4` and `Hlow/H1`. |
| Remainder-hit/greedy-support correspondence | `s = 5,…,900` | Zero mismatches. | MEASURED. It does not prove infinitely many hits. |
| `UnboundedLargestSkipLate` row event | `s = 5,…,1500` | Fails exactly at `s = 5,11,12,13`. | MEASURED. A finite interval does not prove eventual or unbounded behaviour. |
| Residual invariant on adjacent control rows | every rank of rows `s=12` and `s=14` | No failures. | MEASURED anti-vacuity check for the isolated `(13,7)` counterexample. |
| Diophantine height at one scale | `d=1000` | Denominator bit length `253815`; comparison value `d²/4=250000`. | MEASURED single-scale size check, not an asymptotic theorem. |
| Relative-margin scan | `d = 2,…,2000` | Record low `1.13×10^-4` at `d=1136`; no danger-zone instance. | MEASURED. It does not establish a positive lower bound. |
| Exact endpoint-certificate probe | all `960` pairs `1≤N≤120`, `1≤h≤8`, searching `1≤L≤400`; additional `h=1` probes at `N=200,500,1000,2000,5000`; exact LCM-diagonal pairs `(N,h)=(lcm(1,…,t),lcm(1,…,t))` for `1≤t≤16` | No failures. Relative to the least arithmetically admissible depth `L₀=min{L≥1:2ᴸ>2(N+h+L+2)}`, the rectangle's first certificates have excess `0…11` (median `1`, mean `727/480`); the 16 indexed diagonal rows have excess `0…4` (median `1`, mean `5/4`), and the 11 distinct diagonal scales have mean `14/11`. | MEASURED by exact integer arithmetic. Raw depth must grow with scale because the certificate interval is empty below `L₀`; the finite excess distributions prove no asymptotic law, equidistribution, bounded-excess theorem, or cofinal supply. Reproduce with `python3 scripts/probe_certificate_supply.py --check`. |
| Source-backed checked diagonal depths | all 33 distinct `periodLcm` scales covering positive `t≤82` | Every checked working depth has excess `0…4` over `L₀` (median `1`, mean `40/33`). Five rows have proved least depths, with exact excess `0…3`; the other 28 values are upper bounds on least-depth excess. | FINITE SOURCE EXTRACTION from explicit Lean theorem signatures. It establishes no bounded-excess law at untested scales and no cofinal supply. Reproduce with `python3 scripts/build_checked_diagonal_depth_roster.py --check`. |

Except for the endpoint-certificate probe and the checked diagonal-depth
roster, these rows are carried from a dated audit log whose raw run logs and
executable scan owners are not preserved in this release. Their stated finite
domains and exception sets are therefore historical measurement records, not
independently reproducible artifacts. A
reported late-bit scan of about 14,000 ranks over `s=14,…,400` is omitted from
the table because neither its exact sample count nor its sample identities were
preserved.

The audit also records a selection-biased certificate sample: at depth excess
`c=2`, 15 of 154 samples failed; at `c=3`, 601 of 5987 failed. The sample
identities are not preserved in the log, so these counts are not independently
reconstructible from the release and are not evidence for an equidistribution
law.

## What was retracted

The detailed file-by-file record is in
[`TRUTH_AUDIT.md`](TRUTH_AUDIT.md). The main corrections are:

- `Lift/AngleB2.lean` no longer says that the survivor set is empty. Its theorem
  is conditional on a false `hcof` instance at each surviving class and on an
  unobserved `seamExcess = 2` hypothesis.
- `Lift/AngleB3.lean` no longer presents
  `ratchetOrbit_above_universal_barrier` as a live universal barrier. Its
  intended hypothesis fails at the initial row, and the proved nonrecurrence
  result covers only offsets `b ≥ Q+2`, not offsets `1,…,9`. The file now uses
  an actual Lean bridge to `Recon257`.
- `Skip/D1.lean` and `Skip/Wire1-3.lean` no longer claim to exclude residue
  classes. Their existential threshold exceeds every case admitted by their
  own hypotheses, and the same unobserved seam-excess premise remains.
- `Rem/C6.lean` no longer says the residual invariant is empirically true on
  `s = 6,…,3000`. It is false at `(13,7)`.
- `Rem/C3.lean` now distinguishes the branch it proved from the branch it only
  measured at the time, and points to `Three/T2.lean`, where the latter branch
  was subsequently proved.
- `Bit/R2.lean` labels `badRun_pins_remainder` as a conditional statement with
  no observed instance: it needs at least 12 consecutive bad rows, while the
  measured maximum was 3.
- `Three/T4.lean` and `Bit/Corr1.lean` no longer call `hlow` open. It is false
  at `(7,5)`, and that failure supplies a hit certificate.

No theorem was weakened or removed to make these corrections. The claims were
narrowed to the theorem types and the recorded counterexamples.

## What is open

### Exact questions for a human expert

The command

```sh
python3 scripts/query_semantic.py expert-questions
```

returns a bounded index of the validated handoffs. Open one complete packet
with, for example,

```sh
python3 scripts/query_semantic.py expert-questions XQ249-pivot-decorrelation
```

Each requested input is `OPEN`; the
consumer named in the last column is a checked theorem. The classification
matters:
the first question is the endpoint in exact normal form, the next two are
sufficient analytic producers for #249, and the last two would produce a
counterexample to universal #257 rather than prove its positive statement.

| Question | Exact `OPEN` input | Payoff and boundary | `PROVED` consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `XQ249-lcm-diagonal-supply` | For every `t₀`, find `t ≥ t₀` and `L` with a diagonal certificate at `(lcm(1,…,t), lcm(1,…,t))`. | Equivalent to #249. A proof closes #249; until then this is a restatement, not intermediate progress. | `irrational_totient_series_iff_lcm_diagonal_certificate_supply` |
| `XQ249-pivot-decorrelation` | Cofinally supply the exact four pivot budgets: centred real correlation `≤14X/25`, supplier mean and bad-supplier norms `≤X/100` each, and non-supplier norm `≤8X/25`, with overlap `h≤L-s` and room `16(2X+h+L+2)≤2^L`. | Sufficient for #249. The missing input is a prime-distribution or residual-decorrelation estimate, not another certificate reformulation. | `irrational_totient_series_of_pivotResidualDecorrelation` |
| `XQ249-adjacent-phase-separation` | For every `h>0` and `X₀`, find `X≥max(X₀,1)`, a depth `L`, and adjacent `N,N+1∈[X,2X)` such that `16(2X+h+L+2)≤2^L` and their first-harmonic phases have squared chordal separation at least `19/25`. | Sufficient for #249. Finite scans or average separation do not meet the cofinal quantifiers. | `irrational_totient_series_of_adjacentPhaseSeparation` |
| `XQ257-second-channel-separation` | Prove `HalfSecondChannelSeparatedRat n` for every `n≥7`, i.e. that the exact rational second-channel phase stays at least `1/6+(37/56)2^{-n}` from `1/3`; Lean checks `1,…,6`, and an independent exact probe finds no failure through `n=1000`. | Proves `1/2` attainable. The finite-support exclusion then forces the witness to be infinite, giving a rational counterexample to universal #257. The finite probe does not move the quantifier; failure of this route would not prove universal #257. | `half_mem_mersenneAchievementSet_of_secondChannelSeparationRat_from_seven`; `positiveMersenneSupportValue_coe_finset_ne_half`; `positiveMersenneSupportValue_eq_erdosSupportSeries` |
| `XQ257-middle-producer-tail-escape` | At every actual middle transition from rank `13`, write `C` for the checked producer carry and `Θ` for its nonnegative coefficient tail. Prove `C=-3` or `(1≤C and Θ<C)`. | Also proves `1/2` attainable; at the putative last-false row the checked `-3` theorem removes the first disjunct, and the finite-support exclusion then forces an infinite witness.

The packet does not make an expert start cold. Every ask also carries a
low-confidence current hypothesis, enumerated alternatives, current evidence,
and the observation or theorem that would distinguish them:

| Ask | Current working guess | Evidence that would change the guess |
|---|---|---|
| diagonal supply | Certificates occur beyond every scale, equivalently #249 is true. | A rational representation or an eventual-failure theorem decides the opposite branch. The exact rectangle has first-depth excess `0…11`; across all 33 distinct checked diagonal scales covering `t≤82`, working-depth excess is `0…4` (median `1`, mean `40/33`). Only five diagonal depths are proved least, and finite low upper bounds neither prove bounded excess nor decide the cofinal quantifier. |
| pivot decorrelation | For every shift, fixed `s,η` permit cofinally many blocks satisfying overlap, room, and all four budgets; the centred real term is likely the hard budget. | Exact failure requires one shift for which every `s,η` eventually loses at least one clause. Infinitely many bad blocks do not suffice. An exact four-budget producer proves #249. |
| adjacent phases | Qualifying adjacent separation occurs cofinally for every shift. | One shift and a cutoff beyond which no admissible block, depth and adjacent pair reaches `19/25` kill this route; infinitely many bad blocks alone do not. A cofinal adjacent-discrepancy theorem at that threshold proves #249. |
| second channel | The separation continues for all `n≥7`; confidence remains low despite an empty exact failure set on `1≤n≤1000`. | The least measured margin on the open range is `1033253069/8193024` at `n=7`, but `n=1001` onward is unmeasured. One failed level closes only this socket; a global reachability invariant or uniform sign estimate proves membership and, with finite-support exclusion, a counterexample. |
| middle producer | Every actual middle row lies in the `C=-3` branch or has `1≤C` and `Θ<C`. | One actual nonpositive cell other than `-3`, or one positive cell with `Θ≥C`, refutes this socket. A proof of the displayed disjunction at every actual row proves membership; the final `-2` sieve alone does not. |

No checked strictly weaker handoff currently implies the universal positive
statement of #257 for every infinite support. Named support families,
half-value analysis, reciprocal-mass bounds, and sublogarithmic zero-window
constraints are partial; treating any one as a universal proof route would
overstate what its checked consumer establishes.

The second-channel measurement is source-bound and reproducible:

```sh
python3 scripts/probe_second_channel_separation.py --check
```

It re-evaluates the rational greedy recurrence and the complete failure set
for `1≤n≤1000` from the definitions in
`Erdos249257/GreedyAchievementSet.lean`. The generated artifact is
[`docs/measurements/second_channel_separation_probe.json`](measurements/second_channel_separation_probe.json).
Its status is `MEASURED`, not `PROVED`; in particular, the empty finite failure
set does not establish the all-`n` hypothesis consumed by the Lean theorem.

### Exact systems-review handoff

The repository cannot certify its own human legibility. It therefore exposes a
second `OPEN` question: can an independent reader, starting from a fresh clone,
recover the calibrated verdict in at most ten minutes? The request is exact,
including the response schema, its consumer, payoff, and boundary:

The low-confidence working guess is that a reader will recover both open
boundaries and the zero Farey delta, but may still underweight the concrete
non-restatement results. The protocol distinguishes that failure from the
opposite error—mistaking finite or conditional results for a near-solution.

```sh
python3 scripts/query_expert_handoffs.py --domain systems
python3 scripts/query_expert_handoffs.py --question XQ249-pivot-decorrelation
python3 scripts/query_expert_handoffs.py --template XQSYS-ten-minute-hostile-reader
python3 scripts/query_expert_handoffs.py --response RESPONSE.json
python3 scripts/query_expert_handoffs.py --review-template XQSYS-ten-minute-hostile-reader
python3 scripts/query_expert_handoffs.py --review RESPONSE.json REVIEW.json
```

A structurally accepted response from an identified independent reader returns
an explicit rubric for its result summaries, evidence paths and verdict. A
second identified evaluator binds a final review to the response digest. The
validator cannot authenticate either person or the elapsed time, and does not
pretend to judge free prose by itself. Neither receipt validates the mathematics
or establishes priority or novelty. The same query without a domain filter
returns this systems question beside the five theorem-connected mathematical
questions; respondent-facing output omits the evaluator's scalar answer key.

### Erdős Problem 249

The irrationality of

```text
∑_{n≥1} φ(n)/2^n
```

is open. The finite band through `t=82` and the 123 distinct certificates in
the bounded historical off-diagonal roster do not provide the quantified,
unbounded certificate supply required by the reduction.

### Erdős Problem 257

The statement that

```text
∑_{n∈A} 1/(2^n-1)
```

is irrational for every infinite `A` is open. In particular, membership of
`1/2` in the Mersenne achievement set is not proved.

At level `d`, the rational compared with the remaining tail changes with `d`.
A naive common-denominator construction gives an upper height bound of the
form `2^O(d^2)`, but the repository proves neither a matching lower bound nor a
`Theta(d^2)` law for the reduced denominator along the actual greedy support.
The displayed separation boundary has an explicit correction proportional to
`2^{-d}`. No registered theorem controls the required sign uniformly at this
moving boundary, and there is no fixed rational approximation target to which
a fixed-number theorem applies directly.

Irrationality alone is insufficient because the open branch asks for the sign
of a nonzero tail difference, not merely for non-equality.

## How to verify

Install the pinned Lean toolchain and Mathlib cache, then run:

```sh
lake exe cache get
lake build
python3 scripts/build_declaration_atlas.py --check
python3 scripts/build_semantic_corpus.py --check
python3 scripts/check_semantic_corpus.py
python3 scripts/build_corpus_descriptor.py --check
python3 scripts/test_declaration_head_contract.py
python3 scripts/test_projection_checkout_independence.py
python3 scripts/check_cold_clone_comprehension.py
python3 scripts/check_release.py
```

Focused checks for the headline Lean files are:

```sh
# These dependency chains are not imported by the root build. Install their
# `.olean` files before running the direct checks downstream.
lake build ErdosProblems.Lift.Recon67 ErdosProblems.Lift.CertT67
lake build ErdosProblems.Three.T1 ErdosProblems.Decl.D4
lake env lean ErdosProblems/Skip/LadderT67.lean
lake env lean ErdosProblems/FreePosition/FreeKill64OneHundredFifteenDI.lean
lake env lean ErdosProblems/Three/T1.lean
lake env lean ErdosProblems/Decl/D4.lean
lake env lean ErdosProblems/Hlow/H2.lean
```

The `lake build` step emits build progress and kernel-dependency reports. An exit status of
zero and empty output is expected from each subsequent `lake env lean` check.

### Isolated-tree reproduction record

Measured on 2026-07-26 on an Apple M4 host (`arm64`, 10 logical CPUs, 24 GiB
memory). The source was copied without version-control metadata or a prior
`.lake` directory:

```sh
repro_dir=$(mktemp -d /private/tmp/plectis-repro.XXXXXX)
rsync -a --exclude '.git/' --exclude '.lake/' \
  /Users/willcook/src/plectis-erdos-papers/ "$repro_dir"/
cd "$repro_dir"
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

The cache fetch exited zero in `109.73` seconds. The root build completed all
`8,914` jobs and exited zero:

```text
real 4194.17
user 15939.05
sys  4778.79
```

The build printed ordinary dependency reports and linter warnings. It did not
install every object needed by the focused expansion files. The following
dependency builds supplied the two missing chains:

| Command | Exit | Wall time |
|---|---:|---:|
| `lake build ErdosProblems.Lift.Recon67 ErdosProblems.Lift.CertT67` | 0 | `195.37 s` |
| `lake build ErdosProblems.Three.T1 ErdosProblems.Decl.D4` | 0 | `126.47 s` |

With those objects installed, every direct focused check exited zero with empty
Lean output:

| File | Wall time |
|---|---:|
| `ErdosProblems/Lift/Recon67.lean` | `69.24 s` |
| `ErdosProblems/Lift/CertT67.lean` | `98.81 s` |
| `ErdosProblems/Skip/LadderT67.lean` | `682.69 s` |
| `ErdosProblems/FreePosition/FreeKill64OneHundredFifteenDI.lean` | `53.05 s` |
| `ErdosProblems/Three/T1.lean` | `8.83 s` |
| `ErdosProblems/Decl/D4.lean` | `6.76 s` |
| `ErdosProblems/Hlow/H2.lean` | `5.27 s` |

Two commands did not reproduce in the original advertised order. Immediately
after the root build, checking `LadderT67.lean` failed in `1.74` seconds because
the `Recon67` object was absent. Directly checking `Recon67.lean` and
`CertT67.lean` did not install their objects, so a second `LadderT67.lean`
attempt failed in `2.02` seconds for the same reason. The first direct
`T1.lean` attempt likewise failed in `1.93` seconds because the `Rem.C6` object
was absent. The focused recipe above now uses `lake build` for both dependency
chains before the direct checks.

The repository also contains a source-bound receipt runner:

```sh
python3 scripts/run_source_bound_reproduction.py plan
python3 scripts/test_source_bound_reproduction.py
```

It hashes the declared source tree, executes the complete command plan in an
isolated copy, records command vectors, UTC bounds, exit codes, wall/user/system
times, output digests and bounded tails, and validates the resulting receipt
against the source identity. The release-check row is explicitly marked as
requiring version-control metadata; a default run refuses that capability
unless it is separately authorised. No complete receipt is shipped at
`docs/measurements/source_bound_reproduction_receipt.json` yet. Accordingly,
the timings above remain a dated manual record rather than a
machine-revalidated receipt for the present source tree.
