# Deciding whether a proof sketch reduced its target or renamed it

A proof either checks or it does not, and a checker says nothing about an
incomplete one.  An agent that leaves `sorry` behind has produced *something* —
the question is whether what remains to prove is easier than what it started
with, or the same problem wearing different notation.  That question is
semantic, it is the one a search loop has to answer thousands of times, and
some instances of it are decidable by the kernel.

This document describes what is decidable, what this repository measured, and
what the evaluator in `scripts/residual_evaluator.py` does and does not settle.

## The reported failure

Google DeepMind's AlphaProof Nexus paper ([arXiv:2605.22763][nexus]) rates
candidate proof sketches with a language model, because formal verification
gives a binary signal and evolutionary search needs a graded one.  Its raters
judge, among other things, "the plausibility of remaining goals".  Its failure
analysis reports:

> the agent frequently offloaded a problem's core difficulty into a single
> `sorry` within a helper lemma that reiterated the target statement in a
> slightly different form

and, of that behaviour:

> Explicitly prompting against this behavior failed to prevent it.

Prompting is the wrong instrument.  Whether a helper lemma reiterates its
target is a relation between two propositions, and a proof assistant can
sometimes settle it outright.

## Where the instrument came from

This repository is a formalisation programme over eight open Erdős problems,
and its output is structural: an exact carry normal form equivalent to
irrationality for #68, a complete measure classification of the Mersenne
achievement set for #257, the exact rank `2^e + 1` and an explicit odd-core
basis of the dyadic totient kernel for #249, a first integral of the complex
Newton flow for #1041, exact three-prime prefix-LCM dynamics for #269, and proved no-go
theorems that close named strategies rather than gesture at difficulty.
[RESULTS](RESULTS.md) states each result and the exact point where it stops.

Holding that line requires deciding, repeatedly, which of a programme's many
reformulations are progress.  The instrument described here was built for that
job, and it was turned inward first.

`ErdosProblems/DemandLedger/Hyp.lean` provides `hypOf%`, a term elaborator that
takes the type of a named hypothesis binder directly from the kernel's
`ConstantInfo` and returns it as a standalone `Prop`.  It does not pretty-print
and reparse: the extracted proposition is the binder type or elaboration fails.
An unresolved mathematical demand, which previously existed only in binder
position, becomes an object that can be named, compared and proved about.

Applied to the 259 conditional-implication declarations in this corpus, it
yields 101 distinct closed `Prop`s, of which 23 are substantial statements
rather than side conditions.  The finding, recorded in
`docs/semantic/zones/Z18.json`, is blunt:

> Fourteen of the substantial open antecedents of #249 — the pointwise, ray,
> multiple, diagonal, cone, jump, window, survivor, rank-two, cone-nonflat,
> prime-jump and nonintegrality supplies — are mutually implied, and the class
> is equivalent to Erdős #249 itself. … These are therefore not antecedents of
> the problem in any useful sense; they are the problem restated.

That is not a stylistic judgement about the reformulations.  It is a proved
mutual-implication class, and the reverse direction rests on a corpus
completeness theorem.  Fourteen apparent reductions of an open problem were,
under the kernel, the open problem.

`Basic.lean` names those 101 demands and nothing more; the relations between
them were proved once, by hand, for this corpus.  The evaluator below is that
audit turned into an instrument: the same question — does this remaining
obligation differ from the target — asked per sketch, on demand, against a
bounded proof budget.

## Restatement is also a population effect

The fourteen are one class inside one problem.  The wider question — whether a
reformulation that restates its target is *systematically* less useful than one
that does not — needs a corpus deep enough for the same problem to have been
reformulated hundreds of times.

`docs/reformulation_productivity.json` records what this one has:
3,693 authored theorem-like declarations over two problems, roughly 1,846 each,
against 3.7 Lean statements per Erdős problem in Formal Conjectures — a density
ratio of 499.  Generated certificate shards are excluded from the count; they
are emitted in bulk and would swamp it.

Over the 654 measured statement nodes, split by whether a node restates its open
problem:

| | n | mean fan-in | never cited |
|---|---|---|---|
| restates the open problem | 48 | 1.21 | 18.8% |
| does not restate | 606 | 1.66 | 10.9% |

Restatements are cited less and die more often.  The file states its own proxy
limits, and they are real: later reuse inside one corpus is not mathematical
importance, and the author chose which routes to pursue, so this is a
correlation over an unbalanced sample rather than a controlled comparison.  It
is offered as the measurement that exists, not as the one that would settle the
question.

## What the evaluator decides

`scripts/residual_evaluator.py` asks Lean three bounded questions about a
sketch that targets `P` and leaves residual obligations `R₁ … Rₙ`:

1. **Sufficiency.** Is `R₁ ∧ … ∧ Rₙ → P` provable within the budget?
2. **Restatement.** For each `Rᵢ` separately, are *both* `P → Rᵢ` and
   `Rᵢ → P` provable?
3. **Refutation.** Is the residual demand provably false?

Four outcomes follow, and only two are vetoes:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `endpoint_equivalent` | Some single residual is provably equivalent to the target. The sketch renamed the problem. |
| `residual_refuted` | The residual demand is provably false. The sketch rests on something untrue. |
| `strict_decomposition_candidate` | The residuals suffice, and no individual residual is provably equivalent to the target. |
| `unknown_relation` | The budget settled nothing. Not progress, not falsity, not separation. |

Two details matter more than they look.

**Restatement is tested per residual and in both directions.**  Testing
`P → ⋀Rᵢ` instead is wrong: a target implies every legitimate consequence, so
that criterion convicts every correct decomposition.  An earlier version of
this evaluator did exactly that and flagged a textbook base-plus-step induction
split as the failure it is the opposite of.

**A false accusation is the expensive error.**  Requiring two kernel proofs on
one residual means a well-disguised restatement can escape into
`unknown_relation`.  That is the intended trade: missing one costs a wasted
search branch, while falsely rejecting a productive change of representation
costs the branch that would have worked.

## ResidualBench

`residualbench/ResidualBench.lean` holds eight labelled sketches over two
elementary targets — the sum of the first `n` odd numbers, and a divisor-count
identity — including deliberate restatement, self-assumption, false-residual
and hallucinated-literature specimens, plus two controls that must **not** be
vetoed.  Labels live in `scripts/residualbench_manifest.json` and are compared
against the run; the evaluator refuses a manifest that tries to author a
verdict rather than declare an expectation.

Under budget `ladder_v3_independent`:

| Sketch | Verdict | |
|---|---|---|
| `A_notation` | `endpoint_equivalent` | veto — notation change only |
| `B_reassociation` | `unknown_relation` | equivalent in fact; budget did not reach it |
| `C_induction` | `strict_decomposition_candidate` | genuine base-plus-step split, correctly not vetoed |
| `D_self_assumption` | `unknown_relation` | residual is a tautology; see below |
| `E_hallucinated` | `residual_refuted` | residual is false |
| `F_strengthening` | `unknown_relation` | **control** — a productive strengthening, not vetoed |
| `G_hyperbola` | `endpoint_equivalent` | veto — representation change only |
| `H_incomparable` | `unknown_relation` | **control** — unrelated true residual, not vetoed |

Three vetoes, both controls clean, and the legitimate decomposition survives.
`docs/residualbench_report.json` is the run: every proposition put to Lean, the
tactic that discharged it, and its axiom budget.  The same eight verdicts came
back under this repository's Mathlib and under the older one Formal Conjectures
pins, so what the budget can and cannot reach is not an artefact of one library
version.

Two rows disagree with their labels on budget grounds and are left that way.
`B_reassociation` is an equivalent range reindexing and `F_strengthening`
specialises a general arithmetic-progression formula; the current general
tactic ladder does not close either.  Adding tactics shaped to these fixtures
would turn the benchmark into a transcript of its own tactic list.

`D_self_assumption` is an error by the author of the bench, kept on the record.
Its residual is `OddSum → OddSum`, which is a tautology — equivalent to `True`,
not to the target, because it cannot imply the target back.  It was labelled
`endpoint_equivalent`.  The evaluator was right and the label was wrong.  A
residual provable with no assumptions establishes nothing and deserves its own
verdict; it does not yet have one.

## Running it

Requires a built Mathlib for this toolchain.

```
lake build ResidualBench
python3 scripts/residual_evaluator.py \
  --manifest scripts/residualbench_manifest.json \
  --lean-root . \
  --no-cross
```

The run emits, per sketch, the propositions it put to Lean, which tactic
discharged each, and the axiom budget of every accepted proof.  A tactic
attempt counts as proved only when `#print axioms` returns a report free of
`sorryAx`; a failed theorem still enters the environment closed by `sorryAx`,
so the presence of a report is not sufficient.  Each run carries two controls —
one trivially provable proposition and one unprovable one — and refuses to
report any verdict if the harness cannot separate them.

## What this does not establish

The evaluator is sound where it speaks and silent elsewhere.  It is not a
proof-difficulty metric: logical strength and proof cost are different
quantities, and a stronger residual may be easier because it has more exploitable
structure.  It is not complete: `unknown_relation` means the budget proved
nothing, never that no relation exists.  It has not been run against a live
proof-search loop, so no claim is made here about search efficiency or solve
rate.  And no priority is claimed for the construction; the relation between
this and existing proof-progress prediction and reward-model work has not been
surveyed.

What it does establish is narrower and checkable: for the specimens listed
above, at the stated budget, in the stated environment, the relation between a
sketch's remaining obligations and its target was decided by the kernel rather
than estimated.
